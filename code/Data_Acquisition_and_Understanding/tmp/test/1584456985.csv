These standards should facilitate the creation of REAL_TIME Online applications that make use of Voice, Video, Telecommuting, HiRes graphics, Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online order entry, Fax,in addition these dicussion would assist all to better understand how SGML, CALS, ODA, MIME, OODBMS, JPEG, MPEG, FRACTALS, SQL, CDrom, cdromXA, Kodak PhotoCD, TCL, V.FAST, and EIA/TIA562, can best be incorporated and implemented to develop TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications.  We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2 platforms.  It is our hope that individuals, developers, corporations, Universities, R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.  This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already many corporations have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so do not delay joining if you are a developer  An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject.  If you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the address below.  This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG newsletter as well as a hardcopy version.  We urge all who wants to see CMCs HiRes based applications & the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W, decide to join and mutually benefit from this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.

Organization: SED, Stanford Telecom, Reston, VA 22090 Lines: 28  Picture our universe floating like a log in a river.  As the log floats down the river, it occasionally strikes rocks, the bank, the bottom, other logs.  When this collission occurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the log degrades, gets scraped up, and other energy  translaions occur.  The distribution of damage to the log depends on the shape of the log.  However, to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a termite in the center of the log, the shock waves from the collissions would appear uniformly random in direction.  This is my theory for GRB.  They are evidence of our universe interacting with other universes!  Why not!  Makes just as much sense as the GRB coming from the Oort cloud!

"From: svec5@menudo.uh.edu (T.C. Zhao) Subject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations Organization: University of Houston Lines: 159 Distribution: world NNTP-Posting-Host: menudo.uh.edu      I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,    an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.    Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,    bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,    such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.     The following is the relevant sections from the man page.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)  NAME    bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations  DESCRIPTION   bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on   Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both   24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.    As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their   original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the   many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using   mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The   SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed   in full without being limited by the window or screen size.    As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and   processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss   at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing   subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type   whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of   input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into   another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple   geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with   the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take   advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).    Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing   image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence   turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be   accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image   will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-   nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically   giving great flexibility in processing an image.  FEATURES    Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a   continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete,    the processed image will be displayed.    Current features include    o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing     and filling the ""rotated out"" region with an arbitrary color.    o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with     the option of subpixel sampling.    o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an     image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving     the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to     take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text     strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as     in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha     followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.    o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.    o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation     function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary     forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels     separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of     it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished     rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-     lability of graphical histograms of the image.    o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-     gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at     arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some     user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering     directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,     PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions     independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a     circle).    o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-     to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.    o Performs histogram equalization.    o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of     arbitrary order.    o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.    o Cuts and pastes across images.    o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.    o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause     interval between images. (SlideShow)    o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels     along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities     or as an intensity vs. distance plot.    o Performs image type conversions.    o Converts image formats.    o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).    o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image     back and display it.    o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.    o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the     resulting power spectra.    o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).   SUPPORTED FORMATS       o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS       o  JPEG(JFIF) format       o  CompuServ GIF       o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.       o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)       o  TIFF       o  PostScript(Write only)  Hardware requirements: ---------------------------------------------------------------    Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.  Where to get it: ---------------------------------------------------------------    anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z    where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73     Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking  Acknowledgement: ---------------------------------------------------------------    JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4.    FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.    Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.  ---------------------------------------------------------------   Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate   images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of   your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical   kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it   (and you will like it).      As always, any comments/bug reports are welcome.

To get help type 'help'. You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. 'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc, vol. 27.  To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with subject ""help"" to ""archie"" account at any of above sites.  (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify ""archie"" as the host name and ""archie"" as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could someone mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Inetray - A network version of Rayshade 4.0.  Needs Sun RPC 4.0 or newer. 	Contact Andreas Thurnherr (ant@ips.id.ethz.ch) prt, VM_pRAY - parallel ray tracers.  Volume renderers: -----------------  VREND - Cornell's Volume Renderer, from Kartch/Devine/Caffey/Warren (FORTRAN).  Radiosity (and diffuse lighting) renderers: -------------------------------------------  Radiance - a ray tracer w/radiosity effects, by Greg Ward.  Excellent shading 	models and physically based lighting simulation.  Unix/X based, though 	has been ported to the Amiga and the PC (386). INDIA - An Indian radiosity package based on Radiance. SGI_RAD - An interactive radiosity package that runs on SGI machines with a 	Spaceball. It includes a house database. 	Author: Guy Moreillon <moreillo@ligsg1.epfl.ch> RAD - a simple public-domain radiosity package in C. The solution can be run 	stand-alone on any Unix box, but the walk-through requires a SGI 4D. 	Author: Bernard Kwok <g-kwok@cs.yorku.ca>  Renderers which are not raytracers, and graphics libraries: -----------------------------------------------------------  SIPP - Scan line z-buffer and Phong shading renderer. 	Now uses the shadow buffer algorithm. Tcl-SIPP - a Tcl command interface to the SIPP rendering 	program. Tcl-SIPP is a set of Tcl commands used to programmed 	SIPP without having to write and compile C code. 	Commands are used to specify surfaces, objects, 	scenes and rendering options. 	It renders either in PPM format or in Utah Raster Toolkit RLE format 	or to the photo widget in the Tk-based X11 applications.  VOGLE - graphics learning environment (device portable). VOGL - an SGI GL-like library based on VOGLE. REND386 - A *fast* polygon renderer for Intel 386s and up. Version 2 on up. 	[ It's not photorealistic, but rather a real-time renderer] XSHARP21 - Dr. Dobb's Journal PC renderer source code, with budget texture 	mapping.  Modellers, wireframe viewers: -----------------------------  VISION-3D - Mac modeler, can output Radiance & Rayshade files. IRIT - A CSG solid modeler, with support for freeform surfaces. X3D - A wireframe viewer for X11. 3DV - 3-D wireframe graphics toolkit, with C source, 3dv objects, other stuff 	Look at major PC archives like wuarchive. One such file is 3DKIT1.ZIP PV3D - a shareware front end modeler for POVRAY, still in beta test.   French docs for now, price for registering 250 French Francs. Save disabled.   Some extra utilities, DXF files for the registered version.  Geometric viewers: ------------------  SALEM - A GL-based package from Dobkin et al. for exploring mathematical 	structures. GEOMVIEW - A GL-based package for looking and interactively manipulating 3D objects, from Geometry Center at Minnesota. XYZ GeoBench -(eXperimental geometrY Zurich) is a workbench for geometric 	computation for Macintosh computers. WIRE4 - GL wireframe previewer for Steve Hollasch's RAY4 (see above)  Data Formats and Data Sets for Ray Tracing: -------------------------------------------  SPD - a set of procedural databases for testing ray tracers. NFF - simplistic file format used by SPD. OFF - another file format. P3D - a lispy file format. TDDD - Imagine (3D modeler) format, has converters for RayShade, NFF, OFF, etc. 	Also includes a nice postscript object displayer.  Some GREAT models. TTDDDLIB - converts to/from TDDD/TTDDD, OFF, NFF, Rayshade 4.0, Imagine, 	and vort 3d objects. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric 	views in Postscript. Registered users get a TeX PK font converter and 	a superquadric surfaces generator. 	Glenn Lewis <glewis@pcocd2.intel.com> 	[Note : TTDDDLIB is also known as T3DLIB] CHVRTD - Chapel Hill Volume Rendering Test Datasets, includes volume sets for 	two heads, a brain, a knee, electron density maps for RNA and others.  Written Material on Rendering: ------------------------------  RT News - collections of articles on ray tracing. RT bib - references to articles on ray tracing in ""refer"" format. Rad bib - references to articles on radiosity (global illumination). Speer RT bib - Rick Speer's cross-referenced RT bib, in postscript. RT abstracts - collection by Tom Wilson of abstracts of many RT articles. Paper bank project - various technical papers in electronic form.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC's FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word 'help'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.   +RED +--- +  RED - Listserv Redirector is essentially a mail server. +  The Server Sites that are available are: + +  Location        EARN/BITNET          Internet +  --------------  ----------------     ------------------- +  In Turkey:      TRICKLE@TREARN       TRICKLE@EGE.EDU.TR +  In Denmark:     TRICKLE@DKTC11 +  In Italy:       TRICKLE@IMIPOLI +  In Belgium:     TRICKLE@BANUFS11     TRICKLE@UFSIA.AC.BE +  In Austria:     TRICKLE@AWIWUW11 +  In Germany:     TRICKLE@DS0RUS1I     TRICKLE@RUSVM1.RUS.UNI-STUTTGART.DE +  In Israel:      TRICKLE@TAUNIVM      TRICKLE@VM.TAU.AC.IL +  In Netherlands: TRICKLE@HEARN        TRICKLE@HEARN.NIC.SURFNET.NL +  In France:      TRICKLE@FRMOP11      TRICKLE@FRMOP11.CNUSC.FR +  In Colombia:    TRICKLE@UNALCOL      TRICKLE@UNALCOL.UNAL.EDU.CO +  In Taiwan:      TRICKLE@TWNMOE10     TRICKLE@TWNMOE10.EDU.TW + +  You are  urged to use the  one that is closer  to your location. +  Send a message to one of these containing the body + +  /HELP + +  and you'll get more instructions.   Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.

Scene description languages ==============================  NFF ---   Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some   procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects   floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in   HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can   use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.   (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)  OFF ---   Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com). [ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,  I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]    Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this   service, send a message with a ""Subject:"" line containing only the word   ""help"" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.   [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF   previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in   godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,   also on gondwana.  TDDD ---- It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF, Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects. Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,   Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables   for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views   in Postscript.  P3D ---   From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight   extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp   interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to   have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.    The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon   Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D   without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.    The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:   Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,   Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from   VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.    The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines   ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory   pub/graphics/programs/p3d.  RenderMan ---------   Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.  ==========================================================================  8.

It is possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude:  there is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere -- beyond what is induced by the Earth's rotation -- thanks to the overall circulation pattern of the atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends, flowing back to equator where it is warmed and rises), and this helps just enough to make Everest- without-oxygen feasible.

"From: daveb@pogo.wv.tek.com (Dave Butler) Subject: Objectivity (was: After 2000 years...) Organization: Tektronix, Inc., Wilsonville,  OR. Lines: 83  This discussion on ""objective"" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the recent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is ""subjective"" and that even atom are ""subjective."" This is getting a bit silly and the word ""objective"" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the definition of ""objective"" which has been already presented:    objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as      distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.     3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on     observable phenomenon.  The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that thing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable phenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental processes, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable phenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective.  Even weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though that observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon affected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not change to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not objective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the point of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively ""good;"" I will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective.   Now some examples things which are ""objective"":  A D-12 tractor is larger than the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt. There exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks  ultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.  ""Good"" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an existence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined ""good"").  We cannot quantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag full of ""good"").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word ""good"" an objective meaning, e.g.  ""good"" has been used to denote strength, resiliency, speed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see ""strength"" and etc, as necessarily ""good"" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism  is not generally viewed as ""good"").   As to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based on verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of the ""Golden Rule,"" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss people off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a manner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you ""get in someone's face,"" they will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can at times, ignore that form of the ""Golden Rule"" without fear of reprisal.  Now as to whether this enforcing of morality is ""good"" or ""bad,"" is quite subjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing cannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical existence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such thing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a morality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such morality.   One other thing to notice, ""objective"" is many times used as synonymous with ""true"" and/or ""absolute,"" and ""subjective"" sometimes has the connotation of ""false"" and/or ""relative."" Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a conclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be both objective and false.  As to ""absolute,"" it is easy to note that while we can objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean that all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute either.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either ""absolutist,"" or ""true."" For instance, there are some theists who are specifically ""absolutist"" in their morality, even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective has been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a ""gut feeling"" or ""hunch""), to investigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective evidence.   				Later,  				Dave Butler      In starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one's     point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be     simple and dignified.

No.  It follows from the fact that most Christians' choice of interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully determined by scripture.  Whether or not there is some ""right"" interpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to read the mind of their god.

I have argued -- beyond Michael's claims -- that the Christian scriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a wide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their most important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that there is some ""right"" interpretation *unless* there is a way to determine what that ""right"" interpretation is.  It is the lack of an objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that puts the force behind the line I argue.  > Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian > glasses.

There are enough Christian glasses, varying over a sufficiently broad range of color, that I can find a few that support my example.   >> No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel  >> seriously.

The equation of radical =  > liberal, which seems implied by Russell Turpin is wrong. ...  In my opinion, what makes Michael radical is that he fully acknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to determine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity hold dear.  He is willing to live and practice his religion within this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that much of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by ideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have called conservative must also interpret, but they do not recognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and importance of this.  > Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's > theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity; > Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?'

A surprising logical ellipsis.  I think the conclusion does follow.  The purely Christian principles that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in the Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian scripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his political stances.  That one should love one's neighbor is a  purely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance  for homosexuality is *not*.  As to these political stances, they are often at odds with what is commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I  suspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other hand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these  political stances become most influential when presented to  those who need them most.)  -*---- > This is a theological statement worthy of Barth. > Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)  Having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I doubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!

"From: ttknock@SantaFe.edu (Boss Hogg) Subject: POV animating Organization: The Santa Fe Institute Lines: 20 NNTP-Posting-Host: sanjuan.santafe.ede X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]     In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little programs. One is a C program that will perform a ""morph"" between any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there  must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is  appreciated.  ttknock@bbs.santafe.edu  ",comp.graphics

In general no-knock raids are to preserve evidence, like drugs, which can be flushed down the toilet.  They are not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber.

It is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way.  It is the most dangerous way to arrest anyone.  The cops are charging into a room and they don't know what is in it.  It is much safer to surround the place and announce yourself.   >Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's >not an excuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD's, there was >almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who >would pretend to be cops.  Cops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers.   Most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works.  If they are arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea bargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids because the criminals aren't aware that they are cops.  No-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to end in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not committed any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they have the means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the housebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.  The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not called for.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF could have surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.  -- Rod Anderson  N0NZO         | ""I do not think the United States government Boulder, CO                 | is responsible for the fact that a bunch of rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu      | fanatics decided to kill themselves"" satellite  N0NZO on ao-16   |        Slick Willie the Compassionate ",talk.religion.misc

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.  Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.  Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component) frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.  >(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)

Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don't think so. If you take the view that the tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion. I don't know much about panda ""thumbs"", so I'll ask is it opposable?  >>Thermodynamic considerations of surface/volume relationships would >>seem to dictate that active complex creatures  stay in a size range >>similar to what we see about us. 6 inch tall intelligent aliens >>seem unlikely, as do those much larger than the elephant. > >Why can't a lemur or a brontosaurus* be intelligent? > >[*Yes, I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by >putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus, but so far >space aliens are also mythical.]  Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but I'll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I don't think it's likely. First let me say that when I say ""intelligent"" I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter  it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice for a putative technological alien.  Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages  that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains. Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.  Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak. The dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production  because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat.  I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature the size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity.

What's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's hardware.  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple, DEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's hardware.  Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about dropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and cheaper than the one they just bought.  When I used to be a Sun customer years ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386 and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along.  	What's really interesting is that from what I can tell, the MIS folks in the basement with their ES/9000 don't seem to be pissed at IBM. Why?  I have no idea.

It should be available in most good libraries, or through inter-library loan.     It answered the questions you ask (speculatively, of course), along with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies: length of day (for day/night temperature variation, and agricultural concerns), partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses (ever hear of xenon narcosis?  neither did I), density of particulates in the atm, and their composition (ever hear of silicosis?  not much fun), etc.     Climate isn't a global phenomenon and probably needn't concern you, but axial tilt ought to.

"From: mikec@sail.LABS.TEK.COM (Micheal Cranford) Subject: Re: Rawlins debunks creationism Summary: creationist nonsense Organization: Tektronix, Inc., Beaverton,  OR. Lines: 78  John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:   * ""The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *  *  treated as a matter of faith."" -- Francis Hitching                     *    I have a few points to make about the above posting.      1. Science is not based on and does not consist of ""quotes"" from either     real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)     experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive     confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike     (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to     follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests     that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they     are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a     creationist and this may not be your real intent.      2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his     statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the     quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.     Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context     and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate     scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may     not be your real intent.      3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of ""the modern theory of     evolution"" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one     line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that     disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate     claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck     proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond     of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not     actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.      4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack     on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on     science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the     fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long     ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and     irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a     creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.   Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:   * Neither I, nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *    I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster's B^).  Francis Hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (""The Neck of the Giraffe"").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton) using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution (the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a ""non sequitur"" (i.e. the conclusion ""does not follow""). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]    Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was titled ""`Giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far"".  Excerpts include :    ""Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.""  ""He goes after Darwin like Mark   Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and   pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.""  ""He suggests   a mystical `organizing principle' of life, using the similarity of organs   in different creatures as evidence [sic].""    Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not against it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't surprise me much.  It's also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e. he only posted a quote).

Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any evidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven't found any...  Briefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles. Further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is ""No Martyrs for a Lie"": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting.  Since we don't even know how or where they died, we certainly don't have this information.  (By the way, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could have saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.

I have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered by some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It's a good point, and I'm thinking about it. #  #Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know, #therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that #these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process, #restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject #of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological #claim, you have to prove it.  Nonsense.  My ""trick"" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so  does almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore  that A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent.  Now get this:  ""really is better"" is an idealisation, a fictional model, in the same sense that ""real material existence"" is a fictional model. It may or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful _assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist  ""trick"", to wit:  I feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person I ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B, or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B, then it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing more can be said.    I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that  a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the  terrorist's - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical relativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion.  #>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not #>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by #>#others. #> #>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively #>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this #>is possible.

And as long as you don't provide evidence for #that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to #believe your hypothesis.  I've done this: freedom, with the proviso that I still have to  answer jon's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning.  #Further, in order to make morality absolute, universal, or objective, #you would have to show that it is independent of humans, or the attributes #above look quite misleading.

THE SOVIETS AND VENUS                                      PART 3                         Copyright (c) 1993 by Larry Klaes  	The author gives permission to any group or individual wishing 	to distribute this article, so long as proper credit is given,         the author is notified, and the article is reproduced in its          entirety.          To the North Pole!          On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON      rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan      Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe      for the planet Venus.           Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing     yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the     planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic     VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core     was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of     propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by     the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels     were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large     amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The     dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger      to properly transmit this information to Earth.           Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed     the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)     POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a     terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by      the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'     surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles).           The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over     the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects      no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the     VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations      made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the      island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern     pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or      PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially      interesting geological features worthy of investigation.          On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330      million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections,      VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a      polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around      the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA      16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus'      first polar-circling spacecraft.          Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20      for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north     pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers      (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.       The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over      the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back      to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took      eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions      in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers      (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.          VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more     complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills,      mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape,      many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the      last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean      surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the      largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids      would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles)      across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.          There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists     on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes'      owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the      summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest      mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American      scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell      was a huge volcano sitting on the northern ""continent"" of Ishtar Terra.            In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about     Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later     in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar     (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-     nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be      called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan      (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even      finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet      probes maintained that distinction.          Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted     next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the      Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's     temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about     five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few     locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating      current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds      over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles)      lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty      kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees      warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.          When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were      plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at      more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to      pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control     gas to perform the operation.            VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving      the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six      hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an      atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.          Venus by Balloon          For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting      target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of      air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of      the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)     had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint      French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless,      late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.          When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21,      the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full      views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe      since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.          The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named     VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei     being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft      have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one      celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.            This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to      the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.     Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from     the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists      around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such      bodies which actually come close to Earth.            Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar      system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall      in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice      and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar      encounter.          The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and     Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not     wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a     close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical     GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the      comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and      SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance.           Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet     from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel     powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget     cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to     make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of      data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter      and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor      John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.          The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building     an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify     their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an      advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,     the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of      the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the      U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier.      The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the      location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive      in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.          As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA     1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander     making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the     upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers     (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released     by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)     altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had     successfully arrived.           One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was     pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a     diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen     meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as     an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat     consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment     point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,     and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for     measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special     white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which     permeated the planet's atmosphere.           The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just     north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag      would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened      hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.       This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as      well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.       The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar      to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists      had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight      due to the permanently thick cloud cover.          The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day     hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600     kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did     not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer     (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers     (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three     main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the     balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers     (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and     down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the     journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius     (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.     The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds.           Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already     headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with     a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13      and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the     composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the     Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen     minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to      accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6      miles) above the surface.           There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before     touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not     only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of     Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never      before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature      and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees      Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's      56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background      infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.          As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and      12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data     returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The     French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine,      and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active      volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.     The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air     between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)     contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.          The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks      appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.     The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results     nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers      instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were      three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50      and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a     thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles),      much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-     cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air      over the last seven years.          When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last      functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on     for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around     the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March     6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the      dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.     The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial     bodies with one space vessel.          On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for     a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2     balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking     it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning     side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)     flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still     environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.     After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent      for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-     kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the ""continent"" of Aphrodite      Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5      miles) towards the surface.          Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air      layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius      (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1     balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed      through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning     were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer      failed to function.          The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite     Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900     miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother     than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a     relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in     working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite,      rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in      aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree      of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured      463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,     essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.          Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at     a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin      to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030      kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet      is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers      (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three      hours.          Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley     encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the      probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-     Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance      of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets      had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly      a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was      not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.       VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.          Future Plans Diverted          The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous      ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second      world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for     the early 1990s.          This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple      probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft      would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon      probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's      corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over      the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to      investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible      landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main      Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.          Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in     the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA     mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet     and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space      program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction      was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this      class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next      year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on     Mars' largest moon, Phobos.           All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,     including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and      eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.     The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious     consideration of human colonization in the near future.          But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars     exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,     one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other     going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon     landing in March of 1989.           In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to     ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the     mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put      on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have     since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of     continuous robotic exploration of the planet.           During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change     was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began      to ""open up"" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with      the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the      culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking      a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a ""free market"".          These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.     Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making     almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring     nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to      make money.            In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for      sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price      of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary      probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United      States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.          MAGELLAN and GALILEO           The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration     with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.     Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of     spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most      detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When     MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be     able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108     meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.          In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space      Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit      the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle      ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space,      named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the      probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.          In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on     a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around     Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach     Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary     goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the     planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in     that violent atmosphere.          On the Drawing Boards          With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,     new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-     tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet      Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1,      1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions      within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also     considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.          In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects      as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes     throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected     for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing     of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air     temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed     to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air     with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.     Final project decisions will be made in 1994.          Humans on Venus                Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?     At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure     would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something     even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into     changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like     Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking     will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide      atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability      to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster     than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries     if not millennia.          In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand     Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how     a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became     instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?     Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found     through international cooperation, including the nation which      made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

It would have    to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to    ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching    by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at    least it was a good try...  So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances? Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models.  A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject line    get 9304001   Here is the abstract of that paper.     The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them    at cosmological distances;    but as long as there is no distance    indicator to these events all possible sources which are    isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is    why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,    although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs    from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs    originate in the solar cometary cloud    cannot be excluded until it is disproved.     We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE    catalogue up to March, 1992), and    the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to    investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations    between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia,    assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,    at least to some extent, true variations    in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$    test to both distributions.     We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov    test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a    $\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D    cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for    isolating the effect of possible observational biases.    These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but    the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any    connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations    which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\sim 800$    it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.    Currently,     it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement    found for the $\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort    cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \GRBs.

Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate from your own reference frame. There's no inside and no outside, there are just two polarized views. As for statements inside the Bible, things are still not that clear, we don't have any indications for instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament, one of the  few books that actually talks about Satan. Jobs is very much out of line with the rest of the OT books, and there's a chance that someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures.  > Now in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a different > matter.

This operates the other way around as well. You have to understand the mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical relativist. If you don't understand the underlying concepts, it is  pretty hard to continue with a dialogue. I'm not a perfect Christian, however about 20+ years of Christian teaching should have provided me with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame.  Cheers, Kent  --- sandvik@newton.apple.com.

Actually, both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction of the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In this case, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.    The record for acceleration, though, is measured along ""the direction you're facing"" (for lack of a better term).  As I recall, this record was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.  Eric Seale seale@pogo.den.mmc.com ",sci.space

Well, here goes.  The first item of business is to establish the importance space life sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind.  I mean compared to football and baseball, the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight.  I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education.  All of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world.  The document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space.  I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to  succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld (i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering, chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.  So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs.  In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies. This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet, and any other source!

Ablex Publishing Corporation is planning a special volume on ""Shape Analysis"", scheduled for this year.  This volume will be a part of ""Progress in Neural Networks,"" an annual book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and application of neural networks. The primary aim of this volume is to present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.  Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent progress. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling, shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching, surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. Research work utilizing neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as Markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.

"From: mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu (MTA) Subject: Atheism survey Nntp-Posting-Host: amhux3.amherst.edu Organization: Amherst College X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL7] Lines: 100  I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here on the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.    First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give  succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of  you typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean  it) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of  individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing -- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.    Secondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that phrases like ""What would convince you of the existence of God"" imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens. In fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my use of ""God"" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier  than just repeating ""a deity or higher power"" every time.    Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like ""belief system"" although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean. Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases  required to get the precise idea across.    Lastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as you can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.    ---------------  Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum  	Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?   Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.     In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe  in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume  that the answer to this is ""yes;"" if you've always been an atheist, or at least never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)   How serious was your/your family's involvement?    How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?    How and when did your ""final break"" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I  realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an ""event"" per se; whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.     What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) your ""conversion"" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?     Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least  in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?     To what extent do you feel you ""understand"" the universe through your beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you  feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as  an explanatory method?    What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the  plausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs -- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for some time?    Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new ""secular religion,"" and that ""scientists are, in a very real sense, the new priesthood.""  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi- religious base, or even a religious element?)    ---------------  This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me.

Again, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there was only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didn't say all that many things, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have arisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of ""personal interpretation"".  > A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind, > whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present > in any religion.  This is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a system of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least not without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to the point of ""testing hypotheses"" against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all the tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.  >  > I claimed that a ``Christian philosopher'' is not a Christian, > but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those > of Christianity.

INTRODUCTION       From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these objects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman deities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war; Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.       Science flourished during the European Renaissance. Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were calculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries.       But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity and travel to the Moon and to other planets.       The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then human-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the Sun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.       These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight and other ""senses"" of our automated spacecraft, color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light. And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.       Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century.        AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT       The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.       Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well as for processing data and communicating with Earth.       Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power.       Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft.       The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a spacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.       Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid-rock composition.       For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later missions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.       All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power source. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies.       Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus spacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147 pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had originally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The Mariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components left over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.       In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft. Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.       Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers -- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar system. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations. Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun's light becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.       NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters -- descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers from Earth and then studied martian features from above.       Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to ""see"" through the planet's dense cloud cover to study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments -- radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their descent toward the surface.       A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including Magellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet.        The Sun       A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system; all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up to only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the material left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nine Earths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.       As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of fusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there is 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun's surface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees Fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature. At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing energy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.       The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a ""red giant,"" it will suddenly collapse into a ""white dwarf"" -- the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion years to cool off completely.       Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft, launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and the European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity to change its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments.       We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If it were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly never have developed on Earth.        Mercury       Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on November 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a journey of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus, the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the solar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.       Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is visible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar telescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to the voyage of Mariner 10.       The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own Moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interior cooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are as high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310 miles).       Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the density of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon and helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun, surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius (-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface temperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) -- is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time.       Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid revolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury solar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the Sun!        Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would make Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's core or those of any of the planets.       After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two additional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 -- before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the planet's surface.        Venus       Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2 spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the mysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus, plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface, romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest.       On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839 kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured Venus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much closer to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544 miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5's instruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere, radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner 10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.       In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4 of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.       Five days later, the five separate components making up the second spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The four small, independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the surface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour.       Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet. However, spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For example, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward) compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other planets.       Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times as dense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like a greenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is 482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt lead.       A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet. NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in orbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images of the surface.       Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar Terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size of Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a 100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are named for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are the exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion.       Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the San Andreas Fault in California.       Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude, high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour, the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus' slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow in both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six alternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather.        Earth       As viewed from space, our world's distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses and white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor life, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.       Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can strike the surface. Active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the other newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system.       From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our home planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen radiation belts, surrounding Earth.       Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.       Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.       Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather systems.       From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey Earth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways.        The Moon       The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The first human footsteps on an alien world were made by American astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless companion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo expeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.       NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds) and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.       From this material and other studies, scientists have constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy. Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3 billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon's existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain. As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode Island or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across.       This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge, overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers (125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose from inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the surface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance, called maria, meaning seas.       As far as we can tell, there has been no significant volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years. Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars, by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion years ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear.       The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories attempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate body; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars. The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.        Mars       Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.       Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's surface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.       So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out. Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.       Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14, 1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the surface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the planet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water. Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide.       On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to find Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the storm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329 pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features, including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.       In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft -- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from Kennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet, including, Is there life there? Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.       Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976, while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos sent back from the Chryse Planitia (""Plains of Gold"") showed a bleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia Planitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible dunes.       The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking Lander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes. While some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil chemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there.       The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.       The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees Fahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2 site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but because the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking Lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.       The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much water as our air, but even this small amount can condense out, forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys.       There is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.       Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to Mars and were captured by its gravity.       The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The first to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on July 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas. Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut down because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on August 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was used up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.       Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology experiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except Earth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in September 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet.         Asteroids       The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be considered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as asteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have orbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earth has been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded, best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona.       Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More likely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object, the object would be only about 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the diameter of our Moon.        Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It is estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be photographed through Earth-based telescopes.       Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of Earth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are called meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the meteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes Earth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.       Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of silicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks.       Since asteroids are material from the very early solar system, scientists are interested in their composition. Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances.       Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in October 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to Jupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for launch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini missions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy. One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials.        Jupiter       Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of our solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter was the first port of call.       Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in March 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In December 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter, flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's banded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in 1979.       These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize Jupiter's atmosphere.       It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.       The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a high-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a million years old.       Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's northern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned the first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.       Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The massive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey around the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a miniature solar system.       A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under way. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once past Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two asteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into Jupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed.        Galilean Satellites       In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first time, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of their discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the Galilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet-sized satellites.       One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io. Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.       Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow hues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three Galilean moons.       Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the brightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays a complex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been fractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt -- apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its center.       Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and Callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of different brightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of the moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface.       Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the lowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts.       Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be performed by the Galileo Orbiter.        Saturn       No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its exquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmosphere has a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted by high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-looking appearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) per hour.       Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11 sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979, returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in November 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring system and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in August 1981.       The rings are composed of countless low-density particles orbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.       The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. A third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet.       Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings.       Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager spacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its atmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at Jupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near Saturn's poles.       The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons shepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps in the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from images taken by Voyager 2 in 1981.        Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and Venus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge. Unfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's dense clouds.       Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter compound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth between three and four billion years ago. However, Titan's atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.       The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini mission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into Titan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will spend years examining the Saturnian system.        Uranus       In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting Saturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the Uranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet's discovery over two centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.       Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the solar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of Pluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing around the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south pole faced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an Earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system.       Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead, the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's center, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of Djakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.       Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12 percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water vapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).       Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical ""smog"" believed to be a combination of acetylene, ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the planet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as ""electroglow.""       Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus' cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep. Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.       Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105 miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known -- Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from 520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing a geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity, including faulting and ice flows.       The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and winding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that, after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface.       Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged 11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of bright particles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark, boulder-sized chunks.        Neptune       Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system with an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. On August 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers (3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton. During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's atmosphere was more active than Uranus'.        Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the size of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager 2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed the ""Scooter,"" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any planet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per hour.       Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like Uranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.       Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's spin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is similar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores, where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on the other hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center.       Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings. Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected these arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings. A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies were not spotted.       Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in 1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new moons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since Proteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet's glare for observers on Earth.        Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in astronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian gravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet's modest current rings.       Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of Io and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at Saturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed of water-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain: the so-called ""cantaloupe"" terrain and a receding ice cap.        Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers (1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as thick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet found in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees Fahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited.        Pluto       Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside Neptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will remain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined -- tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.       Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to be approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the size of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto's surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spin axis is tipped by 122 degrees.        The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in 1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: the moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane ice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto's and Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution are all 6.4 Earth days.        Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission.        Comets       The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star.       Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets.       As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma or cloud-like ""head"" that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the Sun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes on this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet's ""tails."" Gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly. As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc.       Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in effect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun. The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in length, but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets -- from the Latin cometa, meaning ""long-haired"" -- are essentially dramatic light shows.       Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system.       Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet, returning on an average of once every 76 years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit. Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley, because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return, based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name became part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet returned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to see it.       A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent appearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was visible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so bright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime. Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.       The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer in 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by Halley's Comet in 1986.        Conclusion       Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959, spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space.        We have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets beyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large as small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar environment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects.       The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets, moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and similarities, we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole.       We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather systems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the solar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on Earth.       We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission is mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future missions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid belt.       We can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not been back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian outposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony!  - end -       ",sci.space

Well for starters, why use rle files?  You might have a specific program that needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg 24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.  The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files. And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90% quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything else even an 8bit gif!

I _do_ know that BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of long-term sources.

Do you know of the world-wide-web?  This is a global hypertext (well,  hypermedia) network running on the internet.

If you'd like to explore, I'd suggest getting the XMosaic program, written at the NCSA.  It's an X-windows web browser, and is pretty slick.

Added   some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,   XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.   to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the   plotting area for zooming-in. Version V6.0 has a log of bugs fixed and a   log of improvements against V6-beta. Additionally I did some other   changes/extensions, besides       -     Origin and frame lines for axes.   -     Subgrid lines on subtic positions.   -     Line plots in different line types (lines, points, lines+points,    impulses, lines+impulses, steps, bars), line styles (solid, dotted,    dashed, dot-dashed) and marker types for data points.   -     Legend at the right or left hand side of the plot.   -     Optional drawing to a pixmap instead of a window.   -     Layout callback for aligning axis positions when using    multiple plotters in one application.

Despite its small size and quickness,   it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:   standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,   mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or   different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each   graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually   infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are   almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four   different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and   other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.   Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),   including a portable metafile format and renderer.      Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on   hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot      At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:      Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix   Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT      Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   ""Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: ""Laplacian, medium noise filter"", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber   software.   MIRAGE ------   It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the   Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.   It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image   processing displaying functions built in.   DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ----------------------------   The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is   compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.   Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.  MAXEN386 --------   A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does   maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital   Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is   mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92   (an article on CCD's vs film).

Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Supports 24-bit display""  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,    point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and    quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights    or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass    back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)    to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system. o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to    HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.) o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

Sometimes it is good to know your >enemy, and if you want to do serious research you have to understand >both sides, and not solely the one and only right one.  Yes, one does.  I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by I think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that Benjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings on Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how much he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and  Aristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus makes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology, the id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus explained it far better and gave reasons.  Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They can screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these men on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly, he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.  Here's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians that ""that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is  spiritually discerned.""  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a clue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that's incredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally bizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance on my part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless, it is a truth, explainable or not.  Are any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those dot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in front of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If your eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals embedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand out from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green, you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot test appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.  A normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a total anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something. It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything that to him is as plain as day.  That it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer. The believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns fit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the other hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinks I am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and say, ""No, you are weird.  You do not see.""   Then it is time for a sanity check.  I go to another Christian and say, ""Do you see this.""  And they go, ""Yes.  It is an ""X"""".  And I say, ""Thank God, I see the ""X"" too.""  It is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to the phrase,            ""He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.""   I am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see.  I wish every non-believer could see what they are missing. ",talk.religion.misc

I disagree with what to tout, although I agree that the space program is inherently a good thing.  Most people today only care about ""what will it cost me?"" and ""what's in it for me?"" and could care less about whether something is simply worthwhile in and of itself.  Our society has become increasingly geared toward the short-term (which you could read as NOW!).  They couldn't care less about next week, much less next century.  They want something to show for the expenditure and they want it *now*.  I think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that are spinoffs of the space program.  That is the only way you can *prove* its worth to *them* - and they vote and pay taxes too.

"From: turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin) Subject: History & texts (was: Ancient references to Christianity) Organization: CS Dept, University of Texas at Austin Lines: 78 NNTP-Posting-Host: saltillo.cs.utexas.edu Summary: In response to Mike Cobb.  -*---- In article <C5ztJu.FKx@news.cso.uiuc.edu> cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb) writes: > Why is the NT tossed out as info on Jesus.  I realize it is  > normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what > are the other reasons?  Far from being ""tossed out,"" the gospels are taken, almost universally, as the primary source of information about Jesus. I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who ""tosses out"" the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this, but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb ascribes this more broadly.  Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels *not* taken as ""gospel truth"" that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken this way by a critical reader.  There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text, measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the text as ""historically valid"" or ""tosses out"" the text.  I suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority, and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice.  Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history.  First, all texts are historically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I have never seen a notion of ""historical validity"" that makes any sense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as telling the ""gospel truth"" about historical events, in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite author's history of whatever.)  Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some person (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every text can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can we learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does the text provide evidence?  The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical evidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the  vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The modern American history textbooks that whitewash ""great American figures"" are historical evidence.  These are all historical evidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all that the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that ""great American figures"" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school. They are better evidence that some people ""saw"" the Maharishi, late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe ""saw"" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history.  How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer. There are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's ""Historian's Fallacies"" as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy to read.  Give it a try.  Russell  ",talk.religion.misc

The CLIPPER initiative is an announcement by Clinton that all the  ""secure"" voice phones will use the same crypto chip, as a de-facto government standard.  Problem is, the government is admitting that they hold the keys to break the code easily, and the Justice department will be using the keys to listen in on ""illegal activities.""  Many people are really scared about such an initiative because it is a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things like email if you read the press release.  The project was developed by NSA and given to NIST.  It uses two keys S1 and S2 that the government claims are needed to break the code.  They claim that these keys will be handed to two different companies, and when they get a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip), they have to get the keys from both companies.  People have poked holes through and through the press release official version and shown how it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds, and I have given the simplified version.

I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze. This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion, a lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence.  > Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe. So .. ?  I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.  I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over, I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works, thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit that I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.  > No one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let > me ask you a question.  Do you beleive what you learn in history class, or for > that matter anything in school.  I mean it's just what other people have told > you and you don't want to swallow what others say. right ... ?  I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what other people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I read. I learned what it means to use _reason_.  As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload considerably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first attempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson:   No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X, it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take a leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent.  But it can still be wrong.   I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear,  filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god playing any part.   > The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.  Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance, the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.  Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.  > As much > as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and  > what not to?  This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind, and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the evidence.   It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not. I assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.  > There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.

Were you ever willing to > die for what you believed?    A liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible again.   I was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered as heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is  very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.  Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind. But if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I just don't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence, it looks like she doesn't.

Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you  have to feel guilty, and then there's this single personality that will save you from this universal guilt feeling.  Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all, I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.  If things happen wrong, I will try to learn from the mistakes and go on.  This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain religious doctrines. And if your personality type is  opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain world view system.  > So do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.

There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However, there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network. To be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large part of the problem.  In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.

It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion.  >It could do some scanning of not only Pluto, but also of the solar system, >objects near and aaroundpluto, as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy >without having much of the solar system to worry about..

Among these are drug abuse, sexual perversion, and political  incorrectness. Today Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants. He had been accused of a number of differing crimes (inconsistantly) over the last two months, but  this is the first time I have heard that one. I had heard child abuse but this is somewhat stronger. It is fairly obvious that Koresh  was hiding behind the children; and ironicly considering his apocalyptic dread, believed enough in the American People's inherent goodness to believe he was protected. It is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of  the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal, crazy, a child abuser and  a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons had said. Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found that they have screwed up.  But they don't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost.

The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!  For example:  	SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same 	thing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the 	annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite, 	which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the 	proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.  	TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.  	Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI 	membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings, 	these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic 	rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.  	SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the 	Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to 	be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG 	also has doubled its membership fee.  What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple, like SIGGRAPH, all the ""plus"" services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they don't look so big.  But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31% increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31% inflation rate on the publications I got last year.

Well, I was dead wrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR, which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin. Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to take another ISM class :-(    In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is  that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially Uranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune - we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller, already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through Neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].    He notes that the two recently discovered ""Kuiper Belt"" objects, 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same  mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks, formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to ideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different (Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence for the impact theory.    He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's  orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members of this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane  frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons by now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think) is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate, and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms bright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going to be very hard to see.    I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.    By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby mission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a Titan 4 to send the probe on ""just about a rectilinear trajectory"" to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like to use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs MUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million for 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the marketplace.    I'm just telling you what he said.

People can recuperate the actual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge anything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit from the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself for the precise terms.  Negotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the printing and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I'm out of the wire-bound ""first editions."") I will make another announcement about the availability of printed copies once everything has been worked out.  FTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then ""cd pub"" (you won't see anything at all until you do).  ""The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon"" is currently available in postscript and RTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made available; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple Laserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in the last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work better.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in by a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the Macintosh and Windows.

The question was, if an alien spacecraft landed in Washington, D.C., what was the proper organization to deal with it: The State Department (alien ambassadors), the Defense Department (alien invaders), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (illegal aliens), the Department of the Interior (new non-human species), etc.  It was very much a question of our perception of the aliens, not of anything intrinsic in their nature.  The bibliography for the article cited a philosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I believe the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral person, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a person.  The paper was quite interesting, as I recall.  >2)  If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly, will >we expend resources from earth to help them? >    I think you'd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes.

But right now, I must admit that I am more  >skeptical than ever.    It will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come, to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.    There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:  DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental ""X-plane"" hardware. It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or building the DC-Y.  I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect for beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If the DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a prospect too depressing to bear.  (Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market for small payloads.)  I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some of them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today's world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line.  >You could change my view on DC-X if you could prove the following: [...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...] >3  that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man-ratable >DC-X successor  Strawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please.  The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations, as well as the ""bird in the hand"" argument your common sense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the Shuttle, not instead of it.  Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.  >4  Most importantly, that the DC-X will open up LEO to more scientific and >technical payloads.  If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M, rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites instead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of begging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.

It depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them.  	Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic way, to religious dogma.

Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge, or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions. More questions can be posed than it can answer. At the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction.  Bruce Salem   ",alt.atheism

Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort.  You can spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches.  What's more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on investment.  If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and the prize is just the icing on the cake.

No, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch.  Indeed, this dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be retractable as well as extendable, and may thus have indirectly contributed to the array-flapping problems.  The retrieval problems are exactly as stated:  it would be costly, would involve extensive downtime (and the worry of someone finding a reason not to re-launch it), and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination. --  SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry ",sci.space

In short, an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on the Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why there are laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollution complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.

Well, with what RIGHT can god #make that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates #every one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). What then #happens, is that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't #ask to be created. # #Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature #(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the #right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?  Dear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions, but that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there are respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you, me, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9) in the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression, an earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by sight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things to become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of God's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of this earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed the Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations (""I will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . ."" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.) resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and those who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who became Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven (""And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth . . ."" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).  To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to God and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices), we made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: ""Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"" Job 38:4-7).  We lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the ""Veil of Forgetful- ness,"" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.  You may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the Bible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular aspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.  #Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so #righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep, #unable to do otherwise that follow the rest? # #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.  (All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd as they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe in the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They will cry ""heresy"" and other accusations of ""perverting"" the doctrines of the Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)  As for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as explained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea Scroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not least, modern-day revelation on the subject.  #I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it. # #                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that #                        he is acting according to God's will, and who there- #     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by #                        stabbing you in the back? # #                                                        -Voltaire   Casper C.

Each section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit, but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items omitted later in the planning process.       This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word, theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and to librarians and information professionals.  Please get the README file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  If you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local computer support person.

"From: ldo@waikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D'Oliveiro, Waikato University) Subject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???) Organization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand Lines: 67  OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime, the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.  First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.  I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default ""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames.  I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used for the results I'd been reporting earlier.  Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...  Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with ""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task switching.  A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.  I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...

For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the  _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render  that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to  think about.  It's not either or.  Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind.    I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily applied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming reason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put  his faith and dogma there.  Not so with the christian religion.  --   jim halat         halat@bear.com      bear-stearns       --whatever doesn't kill you will only serve to annoy you--    nyc             i speak only for myself ",alt.atheism

Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The ""large"" grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed.  Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation.  Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of ""small"" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50 atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed ""average"" temperature.  A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust (Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane.  To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then take the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be cooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background, and I believe that to be correct.)                           Dilution   Temp.

Lines: 81 Organization: Space Telescope Science Institute Distribution: na  >Newsgroups: sci.astro,sci.space >Subject: Re: Vandalizing the sky. >  My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but  got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering  the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO  inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive  of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out  of my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these  rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.)     Anyway, here are my thoughts on this:    I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.   Regards,  Wm. Hathaway  Baltimore MD    (P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome,  just a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know  that other people may not accept it without a complaint.)

Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on faith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  That is what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, or belief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational) justification.  For example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't know why they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.

The faith and dogma part of any religion are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that makes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather than a religion, I can live with that.

Would you assert that atheists >would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a >God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?  Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher is not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.  A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is a special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore, to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma comes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed. Sure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy the needs of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said, and that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the interpretations are flawed.  Science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma. A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to suit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND, *AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs are deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving the beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect the best information currently available.  That's the only rational thing to do.  That's good philosophy.  Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed, and new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding of everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion views its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which conflicts with them. > >Please explain how ""just because"" thinking kills people.  (And please >state more in your answer than ""Waco."")  It's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require a good rational justification of the killing.

"From: lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com (LightWave 3D Mail List Administrator) Subject: Monthly LightWave mailing list FAQ Lines: 130   ----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------  -- WHAT IS LightWave? --  LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a device called the ""Toaster"" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.  -- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --  This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as a group.  -- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --  Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.  You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!  -- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --  To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail message to the address:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain  Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated script based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a delay in joining.  Expect a ""welcome"" message within 5 days after you send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!  -- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --  Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the following address:          lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com  Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address.  NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.  -- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --  Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain  I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend forwarding of the articles to you.   -- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --  I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that relates.  If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>  I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please send a mail message to:          fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com  The first command to the server must be ""HELP"" or ""USER name <passwd>"".  Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile. Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service. Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.    -- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --  Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to the list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>  If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact me at the address:          lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com  Cheers,   Bob Lindabury ",comp.graphics

I have clearly shown one of your shortcomings, if not two.  That is, ignorance of the Bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its  contents.  > I regard Christ as a myth.   Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself. And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not even know what the word ""Christ"" means.  Or which prophet used ""Christ"" to  describe the ""Son of Man"".   > I feel that there are far too many people > offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and > did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.  Yes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Come up with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being said and by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else's interpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you the truth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as  much as a coffee cup needs interpretation.  And remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.   It doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The  Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed  to people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it  their open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because they want you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to know.   They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple straight-forward language.  > I choose the > roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of > any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn > back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.  You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that road doesn't look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  One that goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this, you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly.   >And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your >eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I'm not just spouting off >empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.  I see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading your life.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing  new in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are ""spouting off""  contradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must be sad.  > I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to > definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to > you so you can ask her, face-to-face. > You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask?   Bingo.  For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I look what God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have  hope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has glorious purpose.  > You can't even convince me that it exists!   Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose to lie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for  thousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of  Jesus's story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a  bleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:        ""For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets,        he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead.""  > If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold > pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my > rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can > *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful > it is.  Arrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specific cases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect in heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus does not expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not as his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.   You maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself for yourself.  >>Why would you want to live a good life? >>To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have >>no reason to live a good life.

But that's is not what I feel went amiss here.  You missed the point.  Living a ""good life"" has no eternal consequences. Once they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it  is over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless.  It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth.   But then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things  is bad.  To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is all meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What's restraining you? Life after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.  > In the same way, I think life is fun.

Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.  So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa Claus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I can't similarly apply to Santa Claus.  You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses of Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and ""ignore"" the reasons.  By definition, ""ignorance"".   Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves and flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in human history seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose  blinks red?      On the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar really a king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomon really kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin? Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  Did Sennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a  Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies it.  It is NONFICTION.  Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps you can't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from that of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Or is it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out that it's not a fairy tale?  >Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a >collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without >invoking them?

Holly, M.D., President of Mission and Ministry To Men, Inc., 550 N 10th St., Beaumont, TX  77706.         The inside cover of the book states: ""Mission & Ministry to Men,  Inc. hereby grants permission for the reproduction of part or all of  this booklet with two provisions: one, the material is not changed and two, the source is identified."" I have followed these provisions.          ""Freemasonry is one of the allies of the Devil"" Page iv.         ""The issue here is not moderate or conservative, the issue is God and the Devil"" Page vi.""         ""It is worthwhile to remember that the formulators of public  school education in America were Freemasons"" Page 29.         ""Jesus Christ never commanded toleration as a motive for His  disciples, and toleration is the antithesis of the Christian message."" Page 30.         ""The central dynamic of the Freemason drive for world unity  through fraternity, liberty and equality is toleration. This is seen  in the writings of the 'great' writers of Freemasonry"". Page 31.         ""He [Jesus Christ] established the most sectarian of all possible  faiths."" Page 37.         ""For narrowness and sectarianism, there is no equal to the Lord  Jesus Christ"". Page 40.         ""What seems so right in the interest of toleration and its  cousins-liberty, equality and fraternity-is actually one of the  subtlest lies of the 'father of lies.'"" Page 40.         ""The Southern Baptist Convention has many churches which were  founded in the Lodge and which have corner stones dedicated by the  Lodge. Each of these churches should hold public ceremonies of  repentance and of praying the blood and the Name of the Lord Jesus  Christ over the church and renouncing the oaths taken at the  dedication of the church and/or building.""

Remember that not every nation follows the English common law.   In most countries, for most of history, it was probably true that the rulers `owned' everything not explicitly owned by individuals.   Even in North America, where by the principle enunciated, the aboriginal inhabitants should have owned everything, when new arrivals wanted to use land and resources, they just took it over.  In case Mr. Hart hasn't noticed, there is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what. Of course, if some friendly super power were to give an international astronomy organization some anti-satelite missiles and also agree to defend it if attacked, such a proposal might work, but it would hardly be non-coercive.  Some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space and also to use governmental actions (like taxing power, for example) to discourage them.   This of course would be too coercive for Mr. Hart.  Leonard Evens      len@math.nwu.edu      708-491-5537 Dept. of Mathematics, Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL 60208 ",sci.space

They did, they were.  Cybele was the quintessential wiccan goddess, there was Her and her son & lover, Attis. Yucky idea if you ask me. OK the book says she was Phrygian, from the neolithic matriarchal society Catal Huyuk (Turkey). Worshipped 1st as Black Stone (that Kaaba in Mecca ring a bell maybe????) Carried to Rome in 205BC to save them from Hannibal.   Response:  Is there some relation between the name 'Cybele' and the phenemenon of the 'sibyl'?  Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be.  My understanding is that Islam was founded on the remains of a goddess cult or two.  Many Muslims would not like to hear that. ;>   You:  It gets more interesting. Romans called her Great Mother (Magna Mater), could be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black, prob. IS connected to that Ka'aba they've got in Mecca, 3rd cent. AD She was supreme Goddess in Lyons, France . . . Attis was castrated and formed into a pine tree . . . she should be worshiped on 25 Mar . . . in Rome it was an ecstatic cult, her priests wore drag, worked themselves up in dance and castrated themselves in order to initiate to her, lived their lives as women. They wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit.  Only other such primitive transsexualism I know of goes on in India (where else?) where they do that castration thing under some meditation maybe, I forget by now...there's a book on that.)  Of course, that excepts that weird Russian / Romanian 18th cent. Xian cult that did all kinds of self-castration too, I forget their name.   Response:  I'd love to get details or references on any of the above.  My own exploration of this issue has only extended to a brief examination of the Zuni 'berdache'. _The Zuni Man-Woman_, by Will Roscoe, University of New Mexico Press, 1991 probably has some interesting things to say about them.

This is the Back to the Moon bill, put together by the people who passed the Launch Services Purchase Act. The bill would incent private companies to develop lunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding. There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million.   Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably worse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the Delta Clipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million).

That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him arms to fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those who did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and it's a done deal. Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say, ""Well, we sold him all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad for Kuwait.""  No, unfortunately, sitting back and ""letting things be"" is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein's military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with your statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to sell arms to Hussein.  So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor so much, it was the U.S.'s and the West's shortsightedness in selling arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable, right?  If so, then I agree.

It makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away (reporters, if you will).  As I said earlier, the ""telephone"" metaphor is innately bad, because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the aims of writing these sorts of texts.  (Also, I would point out that, by the standards generally asserted in this group, the distinction between eyewitnesses and others is hollow, since nobody can be shown to be an eyewitness, or indeed, even shown to be the author of the text.)  There is no evidence that the ""original"" texts of either the OT or the NT are largely lost over time in a sea of errors, ""corrections"", additions and deletions.  In the case of the NT, the evidence is strongly in the other direction: the Textus R. and the Nestle-Aland text do not differ on more than a low level of significance.

Thanks.  I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).  Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.  This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.  	Graeme Gill.  ########################################################################### ""A note on gamma correction and images""  Author: Graeme W. Gill         graeme@labtam.oz.au  Date: 93/5/16   ""What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?"" --------------------------------------  Although it would be nice to think that ""an image is an image"", there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some look too light. ""Why is this ?"" you may ask. This, is gamma correction (or the lack of it).  Why do we need gamma correction at all ? --------------------------------------  Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene, then you have created a ""linear"" or un-gamma-corrected image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world). Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this:  Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma  So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to ""gamma correct"" the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get what you want. So you have to do this to your image:  gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)  For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.  If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ? -----------------------------------------------------  The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction. Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are  rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular CRT.  Whose fault is all this ? -----------------------  It is really three things. One is all those display programs out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is. The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying gamma's.  At least two file formats do the right thing. The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression) specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).  Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility) allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has, and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.  [ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends to give a tint to the image. ]  How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ? ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg (provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a bit.)  If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness will be above the center.  If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be around 2.2   [with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA environment variable in your .profile]  How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ? -------------------------------------------------  This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of 1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images (ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected to some degree or other.  If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.  If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.  Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing -----------------------------------------------------  One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium. This is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic. This means images  could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance), if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level.  If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma, and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data, then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.  (I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).  ###########################################################################   ",comp.graphics

After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST's orbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up, they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers. I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit.   Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended duration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.  THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) and Orbiter Duration.     In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle, for a given orbital change.    From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.  Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess, that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,  and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.  or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit. The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing, and longer drag life.  |> and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables |> so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the |> array tilt motors,  and god knows what else  is going to wear out | |From what I've heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two  |sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix.

Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g. thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly, etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it. Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.  In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs. At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should 'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas - and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.

This was all badly reported in the news.  There is no evidence that signs of life found in old rock predate putative planet-sterilizing events.  Rather, the argument was that if life arose shortly the last sterilizing event, then it must be easily formed.  The *inference* was that life originated before and was destroyed, but there was no evidence of that.  However, even this argument is flawed.  It could well be that origin of life requires specific conditions (say, a certain composition of the atmosphere) that do not last for long.  So, perhaps life formed early only because it would have had no other chance to do so, not because it was likely that life would originate under those conditions.  	Paul F.

I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.  So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk about it; I shall.  I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent  as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and  probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.  I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.  A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational to the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to  compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical journals which would address each major life science area.  In addition, ideas for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration.  Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition, we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls of NASA and industry.  I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally eager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regarding how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application to spaceflight.  ken ",sci.space

People seem perfectly capable >dealing with these others.  Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.  The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful options, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats -- again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored by pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that none of the FAX formats are really useful.  What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well, e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have provided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses bytes rather than pixels.  But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them. This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably read all incoming TIFF files.  Some standard.

The attack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation that seems to be the agenda of the day.  It also fits a pattern of increased government interference in personal religious beliefs.

I certainly think publication of the warrant undermines the government's case since it makes no claims of illegal action.  Therefore the federal judge had reason to seal it.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a    version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).    I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results    (for better or for worse).     I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV    a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where    the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space    station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only    5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.     I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot    card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then    imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,    keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled    to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default    ""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten    frames.     I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used    for the results I'd been reporting earlier.     Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.     That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard    disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk    (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.     I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240    size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in    action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's    entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...     Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.     The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with    ""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played    from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).    A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was    very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with    ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this    much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task    switching.     A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see    any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight    stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.     I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also    improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance    even more...

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for ""double size"" scaling, other scaling factors hit peformance much harder).  (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).  Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also make a real difference.

[bug].  Not really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I think this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say, in my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions (prayer, your 'Rapture' example), I don't buy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A=0.  In my example, one couldn't dismiss [benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary to explain the dosh.  I brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal' process to show that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you're saying in this post, it seems you agree, and we're talking at cross-purposes.  #(3) is still in contradiction to (1). # #Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account: # #  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1 # #Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it's either the benefactor *or* a bug #which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then # #   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d) # #so # #   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1 # #but (3) implies that # #   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.  No, this isn't what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with necessarily no new observation (we've already seen the dosh) to change those estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that's precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise  would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.    Alternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds that the answer can't be known, or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).  #> As they do when the set M is filled by ""the universe is caused by x"", #> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation #> tends to one conclusion over the other. # #Exactly the point I was making, I think.

See my post on the other branch of this #thread.  Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If the razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which means that you're assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we've already established that it's not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over all i.  #> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or #> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and #> at worst barking mad. # #Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous #occasions. You wouldn't be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank? #Although that doesn't, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case #(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al). # #But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is #""evidence against"" an hypothesis, that doesn't imply that observation of #the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the #estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it's still #evidence against H.  No, I got that.  I'm talking about the case when A=0.  You're clearly correct when A!=0.   And I'm not constructing a strawman (though it's certainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying).  However, by any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely, and when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist, or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this (including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain a fallacy upon close examination.

Keywords: tether, SARSAT, navigation Nntp-Posting-Host: well.sf.ca.us Organization: The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, Sausalito, CA Lines: 38    We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform.  This will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of SEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of Mexico.  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. We want to build it from ""off the shelf"" technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue Satellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have to be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions:  1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Are there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?  2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies?  3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous orbit?  4.  Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of these transponders?

What are your thoughts on it?    I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really offensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher), and read it, ""cover to cover"" (to use a phrase that seems popular here right now).  And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in New Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English: the ""yaar"" at the end of a sentence, ""Butbutbut,"" the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)  At the time I still ""sorta-kinda"" thought of myself as a muslim, and I couldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this was allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives, and had not (as my grandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes; in short, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely.  (And I won't mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)  Perhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent? She can come directly to me, can't she? How do we know that Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up, or put in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some ""holy"" guy. Not to mention murder the author.)  >Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim >posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book >and had called it such things as ""filth and lies"", ""I would rank >Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse"", and so on.  I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really silly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read ""Mein Kampf?"" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don't they just read the book and decide for themselves?

Why?        Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on humanity's sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can have.        I'm saying the Universe has a ""real age"", because I see evidence for it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of people's opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results.  >#      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be >#emirically verified through means that'll give the same result no matter >#who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the >#largish side...).  >  > This assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality > which doesn't depend on what we think.

Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim? Besides, I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim; ponder different individuals, both fully functional as human beings and members of society, but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was ""objective"", at least one should be way off base, but yet hir 'incorrect' morality seems to function fine. How come?        As for producing these individuals, it might be easiest to pick them from different societies; say, an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system, for example (if such still exist).

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File	   Size in bytes		Comments  ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress 			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. 			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) 			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) 			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing 			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just ""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means ""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"", ""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared"" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say ""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to ""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  	""begin"" line 	M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  	""begin"" line 	M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.  --  			tom lane 			organizer, Independent JPEG Group Internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie ",comp.graphics

You're missing something here.  There are people who convert from non-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (I don't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be an interesting thing to know.)  I think that religion is a crutch.  People are naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't want to believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there is nothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy. Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok. That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  This has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their belief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind of useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy with their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too (they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept the harsh reality that they are running from).  Anyway, I'm getting kind of carried away here.  But my point is that theism doesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow up as a theist (although this happens far too often).  Theism is designed to have its own attractions.  >  >     _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist >    _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian >   _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality >        _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility > _/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...

The day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held.  The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:  ¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called ""Bus-1 spacecraft,"" the orbiter and Spacelab.  The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.  Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S. Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.  ¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option, from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data Management System.  Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.  Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the U.S. lab.  Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.  Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and propulsion systems.  The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module, a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.  Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and operations costs, he said.  ¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C, the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after ET separation.  The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 ""decks"" connected by a centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules, and other elements.  This ""can"" would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial attitude.  In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.  Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA.  Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the Soyuz TM spacecraft.  The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will be available to the SRT through May 5.  Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various management options have been developed including:  ¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of command.  ¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate Administrator.  ¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office.  ¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an element of the current program.  ¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.  The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.  As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations.  What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday and Tuesday at which point the design will be ""frozen"" to begin the detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to be held May 3.  Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.  Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being carried on the schedule are:  April 26 Design Freeze on Options for Costing  April 27 Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT  May 3 Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee  May 15 Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee  June 7 Final report to Redesign Advisory Committee   (Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)   ",sci.space

The duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are all critical parts of the equation. I remember one note about instrumented gridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor, either by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sled decelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It had to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that G. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sitting straight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad it can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and a good G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G.  A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a fluid, and high-pressure situations are not new. Anyone have any figures?  Ray Fairfield fairfiel@zeus.usq.edu.au  ",sci.space

[deletia: Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from a civil liberties issue, not an attempt to justify Koresh's beliefs and/or practices.]  I agree with Joe about this: if some group wants to believe in whatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live together and have group sex, or no sex, or sex only for the leaders (but NOT with children), then, as much as I might believe them to be misguided, I think they should have the legal right.  And I hope the investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any *legitimate* reason for going after Koresh in the first place (before moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used).  [Joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations.  I'll (provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to support the allegations?]  Actually I wasn't thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but about the reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, several women in the cult.  I agree this is not a legal matter - consenting adults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh's beliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not a civil liberties perspective.

Prior to our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no homelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and more.

The goal of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is simple: to bring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it into a reality in their own lives.  Every other year, thousands of men, women and children from more than 70 nations - passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand - join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe. Transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go from nation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carrying the message of brotherhood to all humankind.  Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a path for those who follow. Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, the flame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.   		    ----  Making History  ----  The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break- throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian- Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Eastern and Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico and Canada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace; and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II.   		 ----  Speaking as One: World  ----              ----  Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----  The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over - Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and entertainment personalities.  Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper reports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, including specials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show.  > ""I am happy to support your Peace Run for justice, peace and reconciliation. The world must know that God wants us to live amicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the human family, God's family.""  - Archbishop Desmond Tutu, 			  Nobel Peace Prize Winner   		   ----  How It All Works  ----  Peace Run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in New York City on Saturday April 17, converging at various points to lead up to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations Dag Hammarskjold Building. There, runners from around the world were gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.  From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or cross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smaller runs will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, South America, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Distance to be covered: 31,000 miles.  >""The Peace Run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulate the minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hear about the event.""  - Carl Lewis,                      Six-Time Olympic Gold Medalist                     ----  Who's Behind It  ----  The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, an international running organization that believes sports can be a powerful instrument for promoting world peace. Each year the Team puts on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class ultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.  The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador Sri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace, offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless world figures to advance the cause of international harmony.  The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit organization based in the United States.                  ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----  The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a million participants. We're expecting even more people to join Peace Run '93.  You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps, a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer the runners as they carry the Torch through your community.  You can also join local celebrities and government officials in one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the 70-nation route.  Your inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each time you go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace.   		 ----  The Next Step is Yours  ---- 		 ----  Make It One For Peace  ----   For information contact: Peace Runs International 161-44 Normal Road Jamaica, NY 11432 USA tel. 718/291-6637  Fax: 718/291-6978  Peace Run Canada 2456 Agricola Street Halifax, Nova Scotia  B3K 4C2 tel. 902/425-1174  Fax: 902/420-0773  or for the phone number or address of a Peace Run office in your town or country, reply to this message by e-mail.

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.  eg Temperature range of 280K to 315K (where temp is purely dependant on dist      from the sun and the suns temperature..)    Atmospheric presure ? - I know nothing of human tolerance    Planetary Mass ? - again gravity at surface is important, how much      can human bodies take day after day.  Also how does the mass effect      atmosphere.  I thinking of planets between .3 and 3 times mass of the      earth.  I suppose density should be important as well.

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information.  What these people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.  It is called labview by National Instruments.  IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented on both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programming approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program is not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis  capability.  Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great idea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak on the Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation studies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  There are tons of applications, with the ability to create ""virtual"" instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With the addition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station, allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serial I/O support that instrument can be anywhere.  The ground control software for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.

"From: abig@netcom.com (Access Bus Industry Gp) Subject: ACCESS.bus (Re: ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest) Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest) Lines: 92  	Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's  	Contest Announcement)  WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?  ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer  peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that  uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to  a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or  keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR  gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and  others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications  such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality,  Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more  can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts  Plug and Play on every PC.  The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of  systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host  computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a  number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software  development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device.  ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: =====================================  ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone  to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without  fee or royalty. ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single  host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus  data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.  ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware  protocol, with one data line and one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level  handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock  synchronization.    ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three  levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.  I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines  arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C  provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with  different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing,  framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the  receiver.    BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between  a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the  ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an  ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with  additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot  plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus  addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot  plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the  system is running, without rebooting.  APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus  protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular  types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application  Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified:  keyboards, locators, and text devices.  ACCESS.bus support on the PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the  PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the  base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.   An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1  - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with  the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for  multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and  Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples  of the interface from applications to the device drivers.

The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are Christianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers into good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been accomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American Friends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread For The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring to mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names of some analagous Islamic groups?)    When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her Christianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care for those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the power to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespread enough, it can change societies.  The same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianity had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems you are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that religion has had no evil impacts on history.

"From: mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) Subject: commandments I (the basics) Organization: PANIX Public Access Unix, NYC Lines: 205  Why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to Christians, why do *we*) want to find ""commandments"" in the books regarded as scripture?  What's going on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is the *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted ""at"" me often enough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said to have) said, ""If you love me, you will obey my commands.""  [John 14:15]  I am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I should do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother, but still under His direction, though we both call God ""Abba.""  Christians, therefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and discovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure. Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as ""slaves of Christ"") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts (whether classified as ""inspired"" or not) that are held up as models, in an effort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges from ""devotional"" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon- ical scripture as ""the Word of God.""  And at the highest pitch, this leads to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that can act as ""absolute"" guidance for our actions.  The problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians have looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not because *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay is Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the witness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments can we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard question.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike *most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason and c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]  Earlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] ""I give you a new  commandment: love one another.""  This is the ONLY place in the NT where Christians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we *readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus says, ""Take this [bread]; this is my body.""  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26, Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_), and hence this, too, is a ""commandment.""  In *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the evangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment from our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to ""bind"" Christians to the original command to his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.  I am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that it is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command. I take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion, that *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command directed at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference. The command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a ""disciple"" of Christ.  All reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out of the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts -- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without *some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original languages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows, that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control [ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current purposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser- vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done.  Among the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general* commandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that one occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic ""Great Commandment"" is that we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, ""You have learnt how it was said: 'You must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy.  But I say to you: love your enemies.""  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted does NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption. (And Leviticus is at pains to say that the ""love"" should extend to strangers amongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context, goes on to have Jesus say. ""Even sinners love those who love them."" [6:27] All of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the scope of the ""new commandment"" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In short, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command that is ""in force"" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other Christians.  Trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is the case of the ""Great Commission"" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve are sent out to evangelize, ""Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand.""  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather specific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in ""Do not turn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town"" -- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to Jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians than the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING such an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference is NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to have felt obliged to ""proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand"" even (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to the ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as a ""commandment"" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I ""accept"" this?  I don't know.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may) infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this kind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must* have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable length) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions* involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural (though people will do their best to ""justify"" their assumptions by OTHER references to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)  Let's move on to the ""Great Commandment"" -- that we should love God with our whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic ""equivalent"" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED as a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with the Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]  	""But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees 	they got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question, 	""Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?""  It is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus' answer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a polemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer in a far more positive light as (so the ""scribe"" in this version says) ""far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this) or sacrifice.""  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question ""to disconcert"" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains [ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on Christians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears HAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite different) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.  The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted that ONLY in Luke do we get the ""fixing"" of this command by the parable of the Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where 7:12 gives the ""Golden Rule"" as ""the meaning of the Law and the Prophets"" (and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation before Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely reasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not *explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of inter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this ""intertextuality.""  My discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ ""has"" to apply beyond the  community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers, applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the presentation not saying so explicitly) a ""commandment"" to Christians. Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.  The contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at those sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as  commandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is  pretty clear, ""The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her.""  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew has an escape clause [ ""except in the case of fornication"", 5:31 ]. This seems to be a rather clear ""commandment"" (whether or not we take Matthew's reservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't, at least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were not explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands of Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition?  I'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this is enough to start with.  The theme is: ""finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions, that is, our own cultural biases.""  I have, so far, identified a very few ""commandments"" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in these, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these difficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn *me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that US law refuse to allow it, or refuse ""unrepentant divorcees"" places in their churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into  consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in even the most ""liberal"" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal Episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a ""private"" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the ""public"" ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing ""examination"" by officials who would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively CREATED by a famous divorce! ] --  Michael L.

If we can't measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics aren't objective either.  That's what I mean when I say there's no objective physics.  Sure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that's maths.  It's only physics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can't do that objectively, we're stuck.

Yes, we call that experimental error, but it's not really ""error"" in the conventional sense; in fact, if you don't get any, that's an error :-)  You could argue that the value of c is ""objective, to within +/- <some value>"".

"From: trajan@cwis.unomaha.edu (Stephen McIntyre) Subject: Theists And Objectivity Organization: University of Nebraska at Omaha Lines: 82  Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or      will he assume the superstition of his parents      when questioning?   I've often found it to be the case that the theist      will stick to some kind of superstition when      wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've      seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,      and the other theists alike.  All assume that      their mothers and fathers were right in the      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief      search for their god.       Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or      aspects of the same religion, but overall the      majority keep to the belief that some ""Creator""      was behind the universe's existence.  I've      known Muslims who were once Christians and vice      versa, I've known Christians who were once      Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known      Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout      their transition from one faith to another,      they've kept this belief in some form of higher      ""being.""  Why?       It usually all has to do with how the child is      brought up.  From the time he is born, the      theist is brought up with the notion of the      ""truth"" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,      the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.      He is also told that to question this (as      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.      Thus, by the time he is able to read the      scripture for himself, the belief in its ""truth""      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a      matter of course.       But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to      inculcate the child the ""right"" readings of      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to      explain away the unexplainable with ""mystery.""      Circular arguments, ""self-evdent"" facts and      ""truths,"" unreasoning belief, and fear of      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat      of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath      of some sort, and the child must learn to put      away his brain when the matter concerns God.      All of this has some considerable effect on the      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the       superstitions he's been taught are nearly      impossible to remove.       All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can      truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,      Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.      Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that      God *does* exist and look at everything from      a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most      theists can somewhat, especially when presented      with ""mythical gods"" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,      & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption      of God's existence and question it impartially?

I would have to say that the ""greatest philosopher"" title would have to go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did  definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it was Descartes who said that ""All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato.""  If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle. This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as ""the philosopher"".  Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.  As for ""modern"" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and  amplified them over time).  I would say that the most influential ""american"" philosopher would have to be Dewey.  But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect was ""American"", but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen.  --Brian ",sci.space

No. The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever built in the world. The Greeks had a love of wisdom, philo sophos, and this great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library.

I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to many newsgroups.  I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image. This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.  Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image, we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.   >And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm.

"From: lioness@maple.circa.ufl.edu Subject: Kubota vs. E&S Freedome Organization: Center for Instructional and Research Computing Activities Lines: 70 Reply-To: LIONESS@ufcc.ufl.edu NNTP-Posting-Host: maple.circa.ufl.edu   More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics workstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the E&S Freedom.   Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.  ------  Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have  similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market penetration.  There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose applications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features, however, will remain much more flexible.  The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system. Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade them separately as needed.  Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications. Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance.

The reflected | ray (R) and the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae. |  | Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours  | along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol.

First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest that the weakness is your reference material.  Get ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.      On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you get some illumination equation like this:          I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent      The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less hand-waving illumination equation is this:          I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt      That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a purple-colored glass object.      Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my ""illumination equation sermon"" to you also.  ______________________________________________________________________________ Steve Hollasch                                   Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc. hollasch@kpc.com                                 Santa Clara, California ",comp.graphics

Organization: University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada Lines: 31 Distribution: world NNTP-Posting-Host: cascade.cs.ubc.ca Keywords: 3-D widget, manipulation, feedback, user interface design system  I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would like to have in your applications.    A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the  application.  It may let you  - manipulate application data, the camera,   3-D objects in the scene and so on, or - view the status of the application or 3-D objects   via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible.  For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated. A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis.   Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The information I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool. Your help is very much appreciated.

Errata to _Graphics Gems_ and _Graphics Gems II is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books.  A list of computer graphics, computational geometry and image processing journals is available from Juhana Kouhia, jk87377@cs.tut.fi.   2) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen.  The simple answer is, you divide by the depth.  For a more verbose explanation, see any of the above references, starting with:  The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes ""Computer Graphics"" book is certainly a good start.  Chapter 6 is ""Viewing in 3D"", then read chapter 15, ""Visible-Surface Determination"".  For more information go to chapter 16 for shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.   3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.  Find a copy of ""Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display"" by Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).  A variant method is described in ""Graphics Gems"", p. 287-293.  Note that the code from the ""Graphics Gems"" series is all available from an FTP site, as described above.  Check out John Bradley's ""Diversity Algorithm"", which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual.  The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as ""doing a better job than the other algorithms, but slower"".  There's also an implementation of:  Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988), pp. 153-162.  avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code, in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.   4) Converting color into grayscale.  The NTSC formula is:      luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue   5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.  The only reference you need for this stuff is:      Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6  But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b&w conversion.   6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.  The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination. This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead, loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse* transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source. This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one 2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling.  However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included, which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: ""A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation"", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics Interface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears in ""Graphics Gems"" (see section [1]) under the original title.   7) Free image manipulation software.  There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions. Here are pointers to some of them:      xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format     conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing     of GIF files, among others. The program was updated 5/92; see the file     contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct. This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.

FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format most often used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.    9) Converting between vector formats.  A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats. The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another. Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.  There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac. A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.  On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation, rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another. As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive site.  A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also, the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can be used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial.  GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2).   10) How to get Pixar films.  The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:      Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price     Luxo, Jr.				$14.95			$50.00     Red's Dream				$19.95			$75.00     Tin Toy				$24.95			$75.00     Knickknack				$24.95			$75.00     Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy	$39.95			$100.00  All tapes are on 1/2"" VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also available:      Tin Toy T-shirt			$15.00     Knickknack 3D T-shirt		$15.00 (includes glasses)  For individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add $3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international, 213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify prices and availability.  Or, just write to:      Direct Cinema Limited     1749 14th Street     Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342  Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:  At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it's available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).      Pixar     1001 West Cutting Blvd.     Richmond, CA. 94804     (510) 236-4000      (510) 236-0388 (FAX)  You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains ""Luxo, Jr."", ""Red's Dream"", ""Tin Toy"" and ""Knicknack"" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I  ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect  to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.   11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?  The short answer is, ""You can't.""  Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable, but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to do the job right, consult the article:    ""A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles""   by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller   in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,   September, 1989, pages 48-56.  For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:    Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture   by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,   Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.  For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:    ""Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves""   by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken   in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),   June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]   12) How to order standards documents.  The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900, mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the complete name and number.  Some useful numbers to know:  CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers; for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.  Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179.   13) How to FTP by email.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying ""help"" and it will tell you how to use it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.   14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.  Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way, the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including treatment of special cases.  Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside, if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.  Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.   15) How to tessellate a sphere.  One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates. It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.  16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.  Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:  Highlights of this edition-      i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through        November '91;     ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG         International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;     iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;     iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;     v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.  The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long. Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named ""speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z"" and is compressed at most sites-               Site                             Dir 	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/ 	karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/Graphics/ 	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/ 	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics 	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/  Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination bibliographies.  These are in ""refer"" format, and so can be searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as ""RayBib.*"" and ""RadBib.*"".  Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This collection is available at most of the sites above as ""rtabs.*"".  17) SIGGRAPH information online  [from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]  ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org (128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.  The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories.  To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to      archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with the command      send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.   18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available  [from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]  ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available in three formats:      text   (ASCII)      rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)      word   (MS Word for the Macintosh) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:  (1) by anonymous ftp     change to one of the directories        publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]     The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word     files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary      mode.      Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the     contents of each panel file.  (2) by electronic mail     send mail to        archive-server@siggraph.org     You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you     first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages        send panel91-txt index        send panel91-rtf index     in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary     information to retrieve the actual transcript files.   19) Graphics mailing lists  There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing.  Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added.

Comments - 26 formats, no software       (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).       Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.   21) What about GIF?  GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like it much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.  Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc, 	alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals, 	alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers  Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files:  /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of:  send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Send a message containing ""help"" to get general information about the mail server.  Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and 20 above for more information.   22) What is morphing?  Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one. Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:          morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)         morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)         m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)  The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards.   23) How to ray-trace height fields  Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses, such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.  The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:  F. Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July, 1988 <musg88.ps.Z>  This is available as ""Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639"" from Yale University, it's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net:      nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z     weedeater.math.yale.edu	pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     princeton.edu		pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     coral.cs.jcu.edu.au		graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z     gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU	pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z  An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.  Another paper exists:  %A David W. Paglieroni %A Sidney M. Petersen %T Parametric Height Field Ray Tracing %J Proceedings of Graphics Interface '92 %I Canadian Information Processing Society %C Toronto, Ontario %D May 1992 %P 192-200  And still one more:  Musgrave, Kolb, and Mace ""The Synthesis and Rendering of Eroded Fractal Terrains"", Computer Graphics Vol 23, No. 3 (SIGGRAPH '89 procedings) p. 41-50    24) How to find the area of a 3D polygon  	The area of a triangle is given by (in C notation),       area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) - 	            ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );  and the area of a planar polygon is given by       area = 0.0;       for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ )          area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );      area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );      area /= 2.0;  If the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is clockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise.  >From Ronald Golman's Gem (in Graphics Gems II - see section 1 above), ""Area  of Planar Polygons and Volume of Polyhedra:""  The area of a polygon P0, P1, P2, ... Pn, not in the x-y plane, is given by       Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |  where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal vertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation operator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal to P0.   25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH  Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM. Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank. Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00, Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)  SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions on Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or Associate Members.  If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you $59.00 (no student discount).  There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.  ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet.  Their phone number is (212) 626-0500.  FAX number (212) 944-1318.

While he imagines the same about you. Clearly we >have a case where relativity plays a big role concerning looking >at opposite frames of reality.  Kent, with regards to the information contained in the Bible (which is the original context of this thread), Brian Kendig is inside a huge wall.  Brian *IS* inside.  The Bible and the information contained therein are outside the wall.   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the absurd things he says.  For example, ""If I get through into the firey pit, I will cease to exist.""  The Bible doesn't say that.  He hasn't a clue even to what Jesus said about hell.  That is but one example.  Now in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a different matter.  And to you and to Brian, relativity does play a big role. What we perceive to be true, depends on our vantage point.  Since I have read the Bible, and Brian Kendig shows that he hasn't, he has  a narrower perspective than mine  (at least in the respect of knowledge of the Bible).   I am proposing to Brian, ""Brian, come up here and take a look from this vantage point.""   But Brian replies, ""I rather not thank you.  I am content where I am.  Besides, the vista from up there stinks.""   And in the meanwhile, Brian ignores the facts that he has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the same plateau where Brian now stands.

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way?

It proved to have an amazing Bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity.   It's immediate administration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving problems  that previously were fatal.  Although initially enormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years, the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude, and within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive then aspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections.  Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promised amazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease. It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and developement,  However it works  less then 1 in 5 times of administration  and costs $2,000 per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost. The drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case,  and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients.

The deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with > the demonstrations, or on the demonstrators themselves, if they were > violent.  To what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour > against Rushdie?  Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there would appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman's right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it's interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up, some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these  groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of  hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard  was annoying.)  Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at ""organized"" Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a ""secular"" Islam - an Islam separated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie made his views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. The scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this time, already a political situation - affecting governments as well as individuals. The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications. At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire - engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.  Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as  this has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind, has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in ""boldly"" defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as a kind of secular ""heroic Knight"",mounted on the his media steed,  doing battle with the ""dragon"" of Islamic ""fundamentalism"".  Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who  grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear,  who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities - who, when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation, continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist. Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief even after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the continuing mischief - all media support, government support was just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief making, was applied to Rushdie.  >You're attempts at justification are not doing the > image of Islam any good.  I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. ""Image"" is the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie. If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture within a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam would then be thought to have a good ""image"" (Principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image). A ""good image"" usually means "" be more like me"".  Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.  >  In Iran, the situation was monitored for many > >months - when Rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free > >worldwide voice that the media gave him, the situation was monitored > >more seriously.

The fatwa came later - much later. If Rushdie didn't mouth off so much in the media, the fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed, no fatwa would have been passed - the whole episode would have fizzled away.

Lines: 281  In article <1746.2BD37A66@paranet.FIDONET.ORG>  Bill.Carlson@p0.f18.n104.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Bill Carlson) writes: > Since everywhere I look, Zoroaster is suggested as being a probable > descendant of Daniel; suppose you prove he wasn't.  Zoroaster is far older than Daniel. If anything, one could claim that, in a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being Hebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority  of the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has Kethuvim or Writing status.]  Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:  DANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name. Daniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's restoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per- forms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel 7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name Daniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).   The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in Hebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels the subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations; 7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7 is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a sequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example, Daniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that is reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede who conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such Darius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of several Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a series of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to mid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith.   The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to that of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in Palestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior to the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral traditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a martyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions of Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of the enthronement of a God of judgment, with a ""son of man"" invested with rule (this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians as Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.   The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur- vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the scientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth Monarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent.   The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah 52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as the select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather advocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation. Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of resistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic integrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour.  ZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from Mazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The etymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name, as uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else- where. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the Greek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old Iranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht, several Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht. We can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra, means ""camel."" The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used traditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when Zarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into common use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books of Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.]   Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in Western culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented, and heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas (""songs""), attributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the Avesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha Spentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha Vashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the prophet's death.   Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger Avesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the Pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid inscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is mentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who seems unaware of him).   The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect way, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose was not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the other hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra, although from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him six thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus, Hermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The account by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes against Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes reference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut Humbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it is generally rejected.   Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as the above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time Zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an extremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close to, that of the Achaemenids.   Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono- logy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord- ing to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander. Again, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the latter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface because it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed by Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around the beginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the part of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this context, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and Vishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium (thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).   Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally on the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus the Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of the first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that period, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same time, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be justified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara- thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the most legitimate.   As to Zarathushtra's land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of valid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that he was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra with Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language of the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose, both on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east, even though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view that he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian region, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however, Zarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia (modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would thus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.   Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna 33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an athravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used to lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the product of a great and original ethical mind.   Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India to Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan, or ""possessor of asha,"" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks truth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate - and blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the ""vision of asha,"" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the ""vision of the Sun,"" a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of ""Aryan mysticism,"" that is, of Indo-Iranian mysticism.   Zarathushtra's greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength of his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force- fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic monotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the evil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl., Frashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti]    Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra's teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi- tions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi- tion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.   Another original facet of Zarathushtra's message, one that is not easy to understand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the Amesha Spentas, the ""beneficent immortals."" These are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous devotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.]   Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (""possessing gray horses""), and of his mother, Dughdova (""one who has milked""), we know almost nothing of Zarathushtra's life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers. According to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at thirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did he succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility caused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of Kavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two years old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (""desiring pastures""), and of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more sons, Urvatatnara (""commanding men"") and Hvarecithra (""sun-faced""), born of his second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (""possessing good cattle"") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned: Frashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi's father, and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (""very thoughtful""), whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again, according to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was assassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the Tuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi form).   The paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi- tion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian communities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as passages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth century, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i Bahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about Zarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man.   Zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the Renaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an ""alien wisdom,"" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer, psychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always openly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as a precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the biblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three Magi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is derived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the Future. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the Sasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the spread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra's popularity in the Christian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three great messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture and heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss- ance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara- thushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was viewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean Oracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a possible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in Voltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.   After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave the name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883- 1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between good and evil.

It may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding  medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees, Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers. It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the  so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis, which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers, but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario.  On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must  ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths, or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work, and therefore it *must* be so-and-so.

I will upload this package to SIMTEL20 later.  ******   You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use          if no fee is gained. ******   There is no warranty. The author is not responsible for any          damage caused by this program.  Important changes since Version 1.35:   Added support for IRIS.   Support Mix/Concat. two images.   Added support for 'batch conversion'.   Added support for 'load/save palette table'.   Added support for 'edge enhance'.   Added support for 'crop one line'.   Added support for 'negate image'.   New color quantization option.   Fix some minor bugs.  (1) Introduction:   This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different   formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)   on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different   formts.   Include simple file management system.   Support 'slide show'. + Support 'batch conversion'.   There is NO LIMIT on image size.   Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.   If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.   If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).   (2) Hardware Requirement:   PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.   min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).   (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).   Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).    The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.    Supported Wares:    * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)   * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping   * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768   * 80387   * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies   * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX    Unsupported:    * DPMI   * Microsoft Windows    Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory   model, SVGA graphics.   (3) Installation:   Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.   (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)   (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible    with original version)   *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with       other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,       DON'T put go32.exe within search path.    *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.    If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment     GO32.    For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256    If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.    For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387    **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.                  Other drivers are not tested.               2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits                  display. You don't need to use vesa driver.                  If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.               3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,                  please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

(7) Detail:     Initialization:       Set default display type to highest display type.       Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).     1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.       The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep. +       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting. +     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,      COMMENT about this program,      Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).      I need your suggestion to improve this program.      (There is NO anonymous ftp on this site)   (8) Tech. information:   Program (user interface and some subroutines) written by Jih-Shin Ho.   Some subroutines are borrowed from XV(2.21) and PBMPLUS(dec 91).   Tiff(V3.2) and Jpeg(V4) reading/writing are through public domain     libraries.   Compiled with DJGPP.   You can get whole DJGPP package from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites.     For example, wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/djgpp   (9) For Thoese who want to modify video driver:    1. get GRX source code from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites.    2. For HiColor and TrueColor:         15 bits : # of colors is set to 32768.         16 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc010.         24 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc018.   Acknowledgment:   I would like to thank the authors of XV and PBMPLUS for their permission     to let me use their subroutines.   Also I will thank the authors who write Tiff and Jpeg libraries.   Thank DJ. Without DJGPP I can't do any thing on PC.                                               Jih-Shin Ho                                    u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw ",comp.graphics

""mothership"" except for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a ""Grand Tour"" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt  that the idea of a big ""mother ship"" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large ""bus"" spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination. The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond. The ""bus"" could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore. Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a relatively great distance. --- The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the ""real"" Voyagers, and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in addition two ""sub-probes"" could have been relased at Saturn, examining that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory-related factors. A small ""swarm"" of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a  small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy,  well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of course.

Unfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message  clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance,  rather than space surveillance        What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at  the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have  programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of)  satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance).       The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating  quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and  electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so.  The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing.       Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches  and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track  of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available.  See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as  the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The  material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in  optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be  that other countries do also.       Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do  it, and why do they do it?

While the context of the time is important, value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some base standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.).  This is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people, for instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look rather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By the Bible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.  >[...scissors and cloth...] Now in the past, our ancestors >did cut cloth with scissors, but they at least knew that >their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth, >so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from >their earlier barbarism, and made the transition to >modern civilized paper-cutting that much easier.""  Sounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see no support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn't mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or even of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.  >|> That complex >|> and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic >|> interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't >|> think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it >|> to attack condemnation of the original history.

"From: e_p@unl.edu (edgar pearlstein) Subject: Waco information accuracy Organization: University of Nebraska--Lincoln	 Lines: 14 Distribution: world NNTP-Posting-Host: unlinfo.unl.edu    .         It should be remembered that all of the first reports came from         the FBI, and that independent observers, i.e. the press, were not         allowed to get close and see things for themselves.  Official         communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue         them.          People in general tend to believe first reports, as these get         the most and the biggest headlines.  Corrections are often         overlooked.           An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found         in the rubble had bullet wounds.  The local coroner, who is         independent of the FBI, has so far found no bullet wounds!   . ",talk.religion.misc

CIA World Map II ---------------- [  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.   If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with   searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)    The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD  NASA ----   Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data   from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,   etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following   address for more info:       National Space Science Date Center      Goddard Space Flight Center      Greenbelt, Maryland 20771      Telephone: (301) 286-6695      Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov    The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.

Polhemus makes a 6D input device (actually a couple of models)   that senses position (3D) and *orientation* (+3D) based on electromagnetic   field interference.  This equipment is also incorporated in the   VPL Dataglove.   This hardware is also called ISOTRACK, from Keiser Aerospace.  Ascension Technology makes a similar 3D input device. There is a company, Applied Sciences(?), that makes a 3D input device (position only) based on speed of sound triangulation.  c. A company that specializes in digitizing is Viewpoint. You can ask    for Viewpoint's _free_ 100 page catalog full of ready to     ship datasets from categories such as cars, anatomy, aircraft,sports,    boats, trains, animals and others.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is: 	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd., 	00196 Rome Italy, 	Piazzale Flaminio, 19 	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.     For more info contact:    Essence Info    Apex Software Publishing    405 El Camino Real Suite 121    Menlo Park CA 94025 USA  [ What about Texture City ?? ]  ==========================================================================  14. Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in   ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  ""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17. Scientific visualization stuff ==================================  X Data Slice (xds) -------------------   Bundled with the X11 distribution from MIT,   in the contrib directory. Available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu [141.142.20.50]   (either as a source or binaries for various platforms).

The Explorer   GUI allows users to build custom applications without having to write   any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. Also, existing code can   be easily integrated into the Explorer environment. Explorer currently   is available now on SGI and Cray machines, but will become available on   other platforms in time. [ Bundled with every new SGI machine, as far as   I know]    See comp.graphics.explorer or comp.sys.sgi for discussion of the package.    There are also two FTP servers for related stuff, modules etc.:    ftp.epcc.ed.ac.uk [129.215.56.29]   swedishchef.lerc.nasa.gov [139.88.54.33] - mirror of the UK site  apE ---   Back in the 'old good days', you could get apE for nearly free.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it""    ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called ""GVLware"".  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI   database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from   a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default   directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different   ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to   contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI ""database"").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""   in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

No, MIS folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts of their budget allocated ""upgrades"", ""maintenance"", and ""new purchases"", and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually ""leases"" and so is the software.  Basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a  Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  MIS types upgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting, payroll, etc.  Now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some reason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year. :-)  Brian  ",comp.graphics

I was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable, logical person, but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition of the same boring mythology I've seen a thousand times before.

"Subject: PHIGS User Group Conference From: hamlin@ug.eds.com (Griff Hamlin) Reply-To: hamlin@ug.eds.com (Griff Hamlin) Distribution: world Organization: EDS Unigraphics, Cypress CA Nntp-Posting-Host: 134.244.15.158 Lines: 173                    FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE            The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24           in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-           laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-           GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-           tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was           represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS           users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-           dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and           academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS           users  to  ""take  charge of your PHIGS"" by participating in PHIGS           standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS           implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,           described his vision of the future of graphics standards  ""beyond           PHIGS"".            Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following           topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,           Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented           Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS           Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and           Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed           a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The           conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-           ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools           based on PHIGS.            Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.            PHIGS EVERYWHERE            At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated           PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to           mainframes.            Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including           conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing           and translucency.            Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-           Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add           advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like           ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.           Radiosity support is also planned.            FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging           graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate           mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase           and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.            TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful           ""2-call""  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-           oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.            G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on           Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-           sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-           tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS           developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS           internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data           Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS           for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described           their application GSE that allows application callback  functions           during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-           izer and application development toolkit, are currently available           on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or           Starbase.            Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows           and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most           of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many           advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-           tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS           or ARENA is available on request.            ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-           tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most           workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-           porates PEX support.            Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital           Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the           DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.           DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with           support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most           GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as           proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and           the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

SYNERGY: Revolt  	...the first in a continuing series of collaborative 	art initiatives designed to exploit the binarity 	of the infosphere.  This series of diversely  	structured art-manipulation projects will attempt 	to stretch across network boundries encouraging 	use of electronic mail, fax, video, photography, 	scanned ""conventional"" art and even sound to  	create multi-artist ""still"" visuals in GIF and  	JPG formats.  Visualists from all technical levels 	are welcome.    	REVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be  	three stages of production.  The first stage will 	consist of all participants creating one still  	work as a ""starter"" piece that two other partici- 	pants will, in turn, manipulate.  All first stage 	""base"" images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993,  	midnight Central Daylight Time.   	Stage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will  	be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant 	for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see  	fit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist 	of filtering the image through their favorite paint 	program.  For ""analog"" artists, this may well be 	printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their 	own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan- 	ning in the image again to be transferred on to  	the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works 	are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.  	Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin 	on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think  	it takes to finish up the image they've been given 	using whatever technique they see as worthy.   	These images will be due on June 6th, midnight.  	All involved will participate in each stage of 	creation.  	----------------------------------------------------------- 	To join, send email/mail with the following info:  	Name: 	email address: 	mail address: 	scanner access?

"From: ash@sumex-aim.stanford.edu (David Ash) Subject: Theory on David Koresh  Originator: dash@Xenon.Stanford.EDU Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University. Lines: 15  My theory is that Koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle and died on Day 9 of the siege.  On Day 11 of the siege he rose from the dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the FBI over the next 40 days.  Living with someone who's risen from the dead isn't easy, as Timmy Baterman's father in *Pet*Sematary* could attest, so after 40 days they did what Baterman did--shot themselves and burned the place to the ground.  Consistent with the facts, isn't it?  Did anyone actually *see* Koresh between Day 9 and Day 11? --  David W.

Knock that S**T off.  YOu forget,  that during skylab,  they did  overnight mission planning for the repair EVA's.   Also during theøÄ    Intelsat Mission,   they did overnight  WETF simulations. I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months.  And as for building hardware,  anything can  be built if you want it bad enough.  YOu forget,  the  BUS 1  is already built.  all they'd ahve to do is soup it up, even test it  on a delta mission.  Don't get into this mode of  negativism.   besides,  at the rate missions slip,   the Discovery won't launch on this mission until March.  that's almost a year.  |More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it |was going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significant |extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware. |  Ah,  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission.  YOu forget,  there is a bum FGS,  the Solar array electronics, are getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission.  The time for the space walks are growing rapidly.  THis was orignally planned out as 3 spacewalks,  now they are at 5 EVA's  with 3 reserve walks.  If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's $500 million saved.

Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study, but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it. If you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication.  >I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to  >succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld >(i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering, >chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created >to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.  As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering the microworld isn't the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them efficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have to orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use  technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of  using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in  dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in  hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is  stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So  now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar interactions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far. We also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.  >So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective >methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies >which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.   First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information out there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation. This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.  >Such a detailed >literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates >and clearly important to existing space programs. >In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into >various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies. >This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the >basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet, >and any other source!  Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net, I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search  first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data base itself could be useful for future engineers.  That's my response Ken, what do you think?  Tim  ",sci.space

I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take the appellation `Rabbi' seriously then Jesus had a full grasp of contemporary `scripture'  Mat21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures...  Mat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing Mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.  Following from this, he would have been in a wonderful position to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:  Mat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, Mat26:54 that thus it must be?  Mat26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the Mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples Mat26:56 forsook him, and fled.  If the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not been accessible then it probably would be a different matter.  --tony ",alt.atheism

This is something that can be checked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead, really can't respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini has responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist modes of obfuscationism.   So, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning  more about Islam, that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's  basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see  who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at  odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve  muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles  of Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than  any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical  nature.

That (""complicated"") isn't in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it's more the other way around. It's from    P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  where G' is the complement of G  and by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).  In a sense, HG is necessarily more ""complicated"" than H for any H and G, so I may be splitting hairs, but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG) holds, with equality if and only if P(HG') = 0.  > As you point out, it's a very simple matter to show P(x | H) = P(x | HG) > ==> P(H | x) > P(HG | x), and thus H is to be preferd to HG. Now to say > that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say P(x | H) =  P(x | HG). > Can you elaborate some on this.  Well, ""P(x | A) = P(x | B)"" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):    P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>      P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)  where k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).  So A and B are ""equally consistent with the data"" in that observing x doesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.  In the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don't know the actual values, and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG.  > Also, in the ""real world"" it isn't as clear cut and dry it seems  > to me. We can't always determine whether the equality ""P(x | H) =   > P(x | HG)"" is true.   That's certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or not a `divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word'.  Now it seems to me, as I've said, that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather *less* well if one proposes a `divine component' in addition, since I would expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn't even equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission, G is `divine component', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression.  > BTW, my beef with your Baysian argument was not a mathematical one -  > I checked most of your work and didn't find an error and you seem very   > careful so there probably isn't a ""math mistake"".

I'm not a Baysian statistician (nor any type of  > statistician), so this would be very helpful.   Not that I'm a statistician as such either, but:  The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the (read `my') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with which I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be answered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable to statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in measurable ways.  This means that these regions of the space of possible observations,  which I loosely termed ""appearances of god/s"", have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.  Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism expends on making ""appearances of god/s"" possible must come from somewhere else (i.e. other possible observations).  All else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn't* an ""appearance of god/s"" must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.  Sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque, but it's rather difficult to put it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total area under them is always unity.  An analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is ""the coin is fair"", and that B is ""the coin is unfair (two-headed)"". (I've used A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)  Then    P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1   P(T | A) = 0.5  }    P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1   P(T | B) = 0    }  The observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible with both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they don't actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must be unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads.  Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The observation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are modified according to                              P(H | A)   e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m                               P(H)  and                              P(H | B)   e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m                               P(H)  Now we don't know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but the multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed.  Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have                   n   e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)  and                     n   e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),  and since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.  The loose analogy is between ""unfair coin"" and atheism, and between ""fair coin"" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which would falsify ""unfair coin"", is analogous to an ""appearance of god/s"", which would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle is the same.  >> Constant observation of no evidence for gods, if evidence for them  >                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >> is at all possible under the respective theisms, constantly increases >  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >> the notional estimated probability that they don't exist,   > It's important to draw a distinction between theism that could > be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can't. > Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible, > it doesn't make sense to say ""lack of evidence"" supports the contrary  > view.

We don't need, in the above analogy, to know *any* prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity. You don't need to know the initial values of the running estimates either. It's clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin) approaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.  All you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for observed x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible under Ha, and all else is equal.  > Baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations.

Any observations you like; it really doesn't matter, nor affect the reasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which would count as ""appearances of god/s"".

OK, we'll downgrade ""*does* interact"" to ""*may* interact"", which would actually be better since ""does interact"" implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced.  > I don't think my theism makes ""predictions"". Maybe I'm not > understanding what you mean by ""prediction"" - could you explain what > you mean by this word?  I'll explain, but bear in mind that this isn't central; all I require of a theism is that it *not* make the prediction ""Appearances of god/s will never happen"", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn't make this prediction either, the difference is that QM and atheism do not form a partition.)  Predictions include such statements as ""Prayer is efficacious"" (implying ""If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious""), or ""Prayer is *not* efficacious"", or ""Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled."" I don't think we have any problems of misunderstanding here.  >> Persistent observation of this stuff not happening, *consistent* with >> Ht though it may be, is *more* consistent with Ha, as explained in the >> Bayesian stats post.  >> >> Even if Ht (""God exists"") is unfalsifiable, that's >> no problem for my argument, other than that you have to let the number  >> of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically.   > BTW, I do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of  > observations as valid - or rather that part of the argument is not valid.  > We, as existing humans, can never make an infinite number of measurments  > and any conclusion that reilies on this I don't accept as valid.  That's fine; I don't claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite number of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and that as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.  > [Renormalization stuff deleted]  >> In the Bayesian stats post, I assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable >> in a finite number of observations.

No: by way of a counterexample, let X = ""the coin is fair"", or more accurately (so that not(X) makes sense) ""the two sides of the coin are different"". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable, and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.  >>> This is partly what's wrong with you Baysian argument - which  >>> requires observations x[1] ... x[n] to be made.

Well, the best thing to do is to read the book ""Parallel Universes"" by Dr. Fred Wolf.   In essence, Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomic particle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid, and in each of these universes there is a particle in a different location. When we do something to make a particle ""appear,"" we are actually causing all the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is one line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some of the scientific community.  Dr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused by the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys that mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolates that if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousness is the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).  It all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is that this would explain the phenomenon of ""magick"" as practiced in my religion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of possible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of communication between ones current, and possible future selves.  I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection of one of many possible futures.  I realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep  an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile  explaination of the world in which we find ourselves. After all, the more we learn about the universe in which we live, the more we learn that it is truly a very strange place.  >Nanci  eric  ",talk.religion.misc

"From: s127@ii.uib.no (Torgeir Veimo) Subject: virtual sound Keywords: virtual sound, surround sound Organization: Institutt for Informatikk UIB Norway Lines: 31  I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is the following;  From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.    Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system?   Please post or mail any answers or comments.  --  Torgeir Veimo  Studying at the University of Bergen  ""...I'm gona wave my freak flag high!""

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled ""A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community"", ""Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"" and ""Hints on writing style for Usenet"" are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.  If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the ""Finding Stuff"" section below.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    ""Alt.Atheism FAQ:"".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    ""Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup"" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are ""help"" and    ""send atheism/index"".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.   mathew ÿ ",alt.atheism

Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be.  The OED gives the etymology of ""sibyl"" as coming from the ancient Greek   	sigma iota beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha  	( S i b ih l l a )  which is claimed to come from the Doric   	sigma iota omicron beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha  	( s i o b ih l l a )  which (if I read it properly) in turn came from the Attican (Athenian)  	theta epsilon omicron beta omicron upsilon lambda eta  	( th eh o b o ih l ae )  I don't know much about Attis, but it wouldn't surprise me to learn that this God was tied to the Athenian capital  	Alpha tau tau iota kappa upsilon sigma 	(a t t i k u s)  The OED does not list any etymology for ""Cybele"" since that is a propper noun, but I suggest that the Greek spelling of that word would be much closer to the anticedants of Sibyl than the two words are now.

On what ra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call ""orthodox?""       ""Orthodox"" is a compound word. It comes from 'orthos' (straight, true,       right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). I use orthodox to       refer to 'right teaching.' Right teaching is derived from letting God       speak to us through the Bible. This can be from reading simple truths       in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.  ra> Who is that ""holds that"" Luke meant what you said he meant?       I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are      pertinent.       Luke 23:43 records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on      an adjacent cross: ""Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in      paradise."" But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead      and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until      Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The      answer lies in the location of ""paradise"" when Jesus died.       Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.       Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and       Lazarus as ""Abraham's Bosom,"" to which the godly beggar Lazarus was      carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus      ""Abraham's Bosom"" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed      waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection.       It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of       hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith      but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven      until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or      even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with      the Father.       Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the      repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But      on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene      (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then      took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise      (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in      Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: ""Ascending on high, He led captivity      captive; He gave gifts unto men."" Verse 9 continues: ""But what does `He      ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the      earth?"" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: ""He who descended is the same      as He who ascended above all the heavens."" Presumably He led the whole      band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of      preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.  ra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is ra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra> ""look at the Bible"" in order to see the truth, but what of those who ra> see Biblical things differently from you?       I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my 'personal       interpretation' is questioned, I usually give a reason.       As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where      there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it.        I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one       views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff       that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can       have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put       forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to       dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views      that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.  ra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really ra> understands it?       If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is       wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.  Simply       stating that there are other views is not a proof.

"From: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com (David Gorgen) Subject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas together Organization: Applicon, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI (USA) Keywords: Z-buffer, roundoff, lines, areas Lines: 84  I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different PEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).  I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures, hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)  The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize ""stitching"" artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid.  Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.  This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair ""backwards"" (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.  I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer, typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching.  But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines ""show through"" areas which they are supposed to lie behind.  I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation; this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX 5.1.  Open questions:     (1) Why does this happen?         --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?         --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines             as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which             could be corrected for?         --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their             interpolators?         --  Something else?     (2) What to do about it?         --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision             in Z-buffered HLHSR?         --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching             artifacts?         --  Am I just out of luck?

David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,    'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or    part of the Oort cloud.     Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge    of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there    isn't a mechanism for the others either.  What on Earth is the ""gravisphere""? Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they  detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances. In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.  _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at least it was a good try...  *  Steinn Sigurdsson   			Lick Observatory      	* *  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu		""standard disclaimer""  	* *  The laws of gravity are very,very strict			* *  And you're just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*  ",sci.space

An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice.

Given that I am not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist,  i'll have to boil it down a bit.  1)  ALl the data on bursts to date,  shows a smooth random distribution.  2)  that means they aren't concentrated in  galactic cores, our or someone elses.  3) If the distribution is smooth,  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLY large phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomena being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena 	OR we are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud,  but then it needs some potent little energy source,  that isn't detectable  by any other current methods.  4)  we know it's not real close,  like  slightly extra solar,  because we have no parallax measurements on the bursts.  5)  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string  impacts or something like that.  So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile.  what i am wondering,  is this in people's opinion,  A NEW Physics problem.  Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect.     Copernicus,  started looking at  irregularities in planetary motion.  Is this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics? just a little speculative thinking folks.  pat ",sci.space

I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with your reasoning.  (Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma). Religion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately, you never  state why faith and dogma are dangerous.    If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in Waco, you are missing the point.    The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the messenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed everything he said.  The problem wasn't the religion, it was the  followers.  They didn't die because of faith and dogma, they died because of their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their parents).  >I have expressed this notion in the past.  Some Christians debated >with me whether Christianity leaves any room for reasoning.  I claimed >rationality is quelled out of Christianity by faith and dogma.  So Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their religion only?  What are you saying?  One's belief in a Christian God does not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at, but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject.   >A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind, >whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present >in any religion.  Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?     >I claimed that a ``Christian philosopher'' is not a Christian, >but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those >of Christianity.

No, because if a person is free to go, he is not a prisoner. >Similarly, if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma, he is not >a Christian.  So, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far too much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this definition imply that one cannot change one's mind.  In prison, however, you can't just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.  The two are not compatible.   >Religion is like the gun that doesn't kill anybody.

It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building Keck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, ""This second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away.""   Japan's 8.3-meter Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!  And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research was done with ""Star Wars"" funding, and some is now being shared with astronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a few years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their  theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.  To say that ""visible light astronomy is already a dying field"" is  pure hokum.  To use the ""logic"" that things are already bad, so it doesn't matter if it gets worse is absurd.

I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion.  We've been progressing towards that goal for 30 years now.  We precede any orbiting mission with flyby missions.  Of course, it gets harder to do as we work our way farther away from Earth.  We're just starting to work out to the outer planets: Galileo will orbit Jupiter, and Cassini around  Saturn.    >How about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things >around and near and on Pluto..   Well first things first. We'll do a flyby mission first since it is much easier and faster to do.  If the Fast Pluto Flyby mission is approved then we'll launch a Pluto mission before the end of the decade.  A Pluto orbiter however requires a larger spacecraft and a longer cruise period.   Orbit insertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts the trajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto. I'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbiting mission before a Pluto orbiting mission, unless the Pluto flyby turns up something really interesting.      ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

"From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov Subject: U.S. Government and Technolgy Investment Organization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office  X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8] Lines: 44  People who criticize ""big Government"" and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term.    (Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)  As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations, doesn't it?)  But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture, despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little sense to try to save money.  Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be.    It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects. GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large construction project now uses these tools.    -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368       ""A scientist can discover a new star, but he cannot make one.

I haven't actually used one or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to see an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or something.  Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that run OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are binary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by simply adding ""transformation engines"".  The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.   			3400			3500  CPU			DEC Alpha AXP 133MHz	DEC Alpha AXP 150MHz On-chip cache		8k/8k			8k/8k Onboard cache		512K			512K Word Size		64-bit			64-bit Memory ( initial )	32-128MB		32-256MB Memory ( future )	512MB			1GB SPECMARK89		111			126 SPECINT92		75			84 SPECFP92		112			128  GRAPHICS  Transform Modules	1-6			1-6 Frame Buffer Modules	5,10,20			5,10,20 Frame Buffer		1280x1024x24bit		1280x1024x24bit 			double buffered		double buffered Z-buffer		24-bit			24-bit Alpha/stencil		8-bit			8-bit Stereo support		yes			yes Other:				both machines will double buffer or do 				stereo output per window.

The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture known as Denali.  The Denali comes in three models, the E, P, and V.  They use a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz.  Their capabilities are as follows:  			E		P		V  2D Vectors		800-200K	2000-3800K	4000-4800K 3D Vectors #1		350-1100K	1100-1800K	1800-2100K 3D Vectors #2		300-1000K	1000-1600K	1600-1900K 3D Vectors #3		300-500K	800-1000K	1300-1400K 3D Triangles, #4	200-500K	600-1000K	1000-1200K 3D Triangles, #5	100-200K	300-400K	500-600K  #1: 10 pixel, flat shaded, connected #2: 10 pixel, Gouraud shaded, connected #3: 10 pixel, 2-pixel wide, anti-aliased, connected #4: 50-pixel, Gouraud shaded, Z-buffered, strip #5: 50-pixel, texture mapped, persp., point sampled  IMAGE PROCESSING  Cine loop - 8-bit	15-36Mp/s	37-58 Mp/s	60-68 Mp/s Cine loop - 16-bit	14 Mp/s		25 Mp/s		38 Mp/s Cine loop - 24-bit	12-21 Mp/s	21 Mp/s		21 Mp/s Contrast stretching #1	14 Mp/s		25 Mp/s		20 Mp/s Bilinear zoom		6 Mp/s		11 Mp/s		20 Mp/s Trilinear interp#2	--		6 Mvoxels/s	11 Mvoxels/s  #1: Lookup table -- 12-,16-bit to 8 #2: Trilinear interpolation, 8-bit voxels  CONFIGURATIONS Frame Buffer Modules	5		10		20 Transform Engine Mod.	1-3		3-5		5-6   As you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part is the pricing.

First, you seem to assume all atheists think alike.  An atheist does not believe in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as  capital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.    If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I  presume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us all together.  As for the issues, let's start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support abortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact. However, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless of what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain of legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That's my opinion, and I am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.  I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I  certainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.    As for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what you're talking about.  Finally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist can object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and  population control.  Could this be the ""atheist cause"" you were referring  to a few posts back?  --  ---                      __  _______                              --- ||| Kevin Marshall       \ \/ /_  _/  Computer Science Department ||| ||| Virginia Tech         \  / / /     marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu ||| --- Blacksburg, Virginia   \/ /_/                  (703) 232-6529 --- ",alt.atheism

The differential arrival time techinique requires interplanetary baselines to get good positions.  The differential arrival at the eight detectors differ by 10's of nanoseconds. This is smaller than BATSE's microsecond timing capabilities. BATSE, Ulysses, and Mars Obsverver are used for this technique.  Each BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view.

"From: pjc@jet.uk (Peter J Card) Subject: Re: Over zealous shuttle critics Organization: Joint European Torus Lines: 40  We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern postulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll get round to it eventually.  The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship, with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke the 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling.  Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time, and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book ""How the World was One"" [ I think that`s right ]  If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely ignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.  Its true the Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they worth doing? With low cost access to space, you could have an affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned missions. As it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as a space-RV, ( only not so cheap to run :-( ) --  __._____.___._____.__._______________________________________________________ __|_. ._| ._|_._._|__| Peter Card, Joint European Torus, Abingdon     | | | |_. | |    | Oxfordshire OX14 3EA UK. tel 0235-464867 FAX 464404     | | |  _| | |    | email pjc@jet.uk or compuserve 100010,366    ._| | | |_. | |    | It wasnt me.

If you are surveying our individual philosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life, the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could hardly be called a philosophical system.  Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities.  Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of philosophy we all agree on.  Some comments on your questions:  > What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) > your ""conversion"" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism > counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    I would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to 'convert' anyone?  > Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational > means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least  > in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?    This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_  cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be  beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily become atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.  Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire lack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))  > To what extent do you feel you ""understand"" the universe through your  > beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything > from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human > affairs) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where > are they lacking as an explanatory method?    This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.

Some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what our geology/environmental sciences friends think.  As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure) is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance. This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in front of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I am not a diving expert).  Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition, the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a  pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?  ken khayash@hsc.usc.edu ",sci.space

Why would the NT NOT be considered a good source.  This might be a  literary/historical question, but when I studied history I always looked for  firsthand original sources to write my papers.

Nntp-Posting-Host: klaatu.watson.ibm.com Organization: Visualization Systems, IBM Keywords: computer graphics, ray tracing, volume rendering       --- Scientific Visualization of Chemical Systems ---              Cornell Theory Center Summer School             Offered through the Cornell School of         Continuing Education and Summer Sessions                     Course Description    Within the past ten years, the  simulation and  modeling of Lines: 197  molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.   While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology, simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists. Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing.   This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming (IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video recording equipment.   Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological            sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art            computer graphics into their research; computer scientists            wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of            scientific visualization.              The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a            first-come first-served basis.   Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken            without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra            and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,            X-windows and C is useful but not required.

Daily lectures will be interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given more time for project development and meet daily to share experience and discuss problems encountered.   Content (may vary)       Elements of computer graphics          polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric          rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow          programming (DX), interactivity.

"Subject: ROCKET LAUNCH OBSERVED! From: leo.wikholm@compart.fi (Leo Wikholm) Distribution: world Organization: ComPart BBS, Helsinki-Finland, +358 0 506 3329 (20 lines V.32bis) Lines: 44        A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland     on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous     pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near     Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part     was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They     were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became     enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle     of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby     forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were     visible till morning sunrise.      The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in     Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in     the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was     only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.     A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a     spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about     five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the     upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop     became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of     the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright     spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails     were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still     visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.      The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if     there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near     Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969     we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of     these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium     experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we     have observed 17 satellite launches.

It clearly points out a possible solution to transcendental values. What I don't understand is that it also clearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any transcendental direction is equal.

Big difference.    That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution    to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well    known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)    are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...  Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to make tight-binaries of neutron stars.  Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but that uses pretty far-out physics.  My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so GRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't rule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which converts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets aren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the ""Tunguska Meteorite"" was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet collisions matches the GRB rate well.  The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them out.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the right distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got the wrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort- cloud GRB's at all.  Executive summary: we don't know enough to rule out out the Oort cloud. ",sci.space

The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.  That's a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked ""Why not,"" I'll respond.  Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to  incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable). Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required. Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.  Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.  The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation effects on materials), so your ""fabric"" may not retain any flexibility for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.  These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368       ""Good ideas are common -- what's uncommon are people who'll       work hard enough to bring them about."" -- Ashleigh Brilliant ",sci.space

OK the book says she was Phrygian, from the neolithic matriarchal society Catal Huyuk (Turkey). Worshipped 1st as Black Stone (that Kaaba in Mecca ring a bell maybe????) Carried to Rome in 205BC to save them from Hannibal.  It gets more interesting. Romans called her Great Mother (Magna Mater), could be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black, prob. IS connected to that Ka'aba they've got in Mecca, 3rd cent. AD She was supreme Goddess in Lyons, France . . . Attis was castrated and formed into a pine tree . . . she should be worshiped on 25 Mar . . . in Rome it was an ecstatic cult, her priests wore drag, worked themselves up in dance and castrated themselves in order to initiate to her, lived their lives as women. They wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit.  Wow.  Only other such primitive transsexualism I know of goes on in India (where else?) where they do that castration thing under some meditation maybe, I forget by now...there's a book on that.)

But it would clarify further if you would answer > from the point of view of any disinterested observers - perhaps an > observer as likely to be in position A as in position B (where A and B > disagree) in the future, and have his or her conclusion now binding on > them at that time.  Well, if our observer X is as likely to be in A's position as B's, and if he agrees that both A and B are making appropriate observations and inferences regarding the situation, then I would expect him to conclude that there is no right answer.  Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow him to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.  If, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.  It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from all perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any conclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my perspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to life; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what they like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in favour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and deciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This is also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own decisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy with current UK abortion law.  Similarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and I really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't even know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.   mathew ",talk.religion.misc

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere > evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question > is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.  This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive answer is ""photosynthesis"", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material.  On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).  This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.  There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback mechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about it.  	Paul F.

I have noticed my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals. It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:     1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge    2) one's financial situation takes precedence    3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)    4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from ""fun"" to ""work""    5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for ""the hobby""  or the biggest killer (IMO)     6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's       version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without       the motivation the effort seems useless.  Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember when there were several completely different computer systems, our children are growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy the diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems that were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely divergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new systems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a commercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being taught the ""user"" mentality.  As the number of us ""old-timers"" dwindle we are not being replaced by the next generation.

Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate Image Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix. 'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C code to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement via convolution etc.  If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I am most likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefer source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing code/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of demonstration it would be most helpful.

If what was being discussed could be established or disproven by  experiment and observation, then I would agree with you, Chris.   The burden of proof would belong to Bill. But the source document for Christianity, the Bible, simply assumes God exists and makes it clear (to us Calvinists, anyway :-)) that when a person is in fellowship with God, it is because God has taken the initiative in revealing Himself to that person. So from a Christian point of view, the burden of proof belongs to God. Bill is being consistent with what the Bible teaches in relating his own experience with God, but it would be an error on his part to assume that there is a direct, causal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming convinced that God exists and that he needs to be reconciled to God.  > >If you are merely giving testimony to your beliefs, then you are an egotist.

Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms are then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack of an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and don't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.  >How then can an atheist judge value?   An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according to a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in an absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit, as in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad. My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I object to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds.  If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving considerable survival advantages.  You'd probably say that God just made the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a common understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it from your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early childhood teaching.  >That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God >or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your >nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled >with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction.   I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're saying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as ""God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites"" is mechanistic, but of course I think that's true of you as well.  My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but if a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him good, which is supposedly an attribute of God.  >All of this being so, you have excluded >yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, >etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no >weight whatsoever.  Hmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In fact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by framing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the quality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters coexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An absolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with, and say ""this is good"", even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as ""excluded from discussion"", such that they ""cannot participate"", and their opinions given ""no weight whatsoever"" is the lowest form or reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right, wrong, and the Bible. --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

Lines: 38 NNTP-Posting-Host: bozo.dsinc.com  Another one rescued from the bit bucket...  Over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and elsewhere on the net.  Generally, the discussion comes down to the contention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against Islam as to merit, if not death, than at least banning and probably some sort of punishment; and on the other that Rushdie, particularly as a non-muslim in a Western country, had every right to write and publish whatever he chose, regardless of whether some muslims find it offensive, without fear of persecution or death.    I am naturally inclined to the latter position, but find myself in an interesting position, because I think this is a fine book, only incidentally concerned with Islam, and moreover I'm damned if I can find anything malevolently offensive in it.  Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book and had called it such things as ""filth and lies"", ""I would rank Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse"", and so on. Unfortunately, these comments are usually generalities, and attempts to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so offensive have met either with stony silence, more generalizations, or inaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me to believe that few of them have actually read it].  Corrections and attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.

First, you are discussing only experimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make prediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be the result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of the lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the observations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science - it is *not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted sense.  Secondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just the requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results. The observation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observer may look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also, there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond to the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is tested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.  Unfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been peripheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, the front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles, rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).  So, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the necessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the original event does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File	   Size in bytes		Comments  ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress 			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. 			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) 			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) 			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing 			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just ""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means ""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,     JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has     image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"", ""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.  NeXT:  ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it. ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared"" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say ""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to ""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  	""begin"" line 	M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  	""begin"" line 	M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.  --  			tom lane 			organizer, Independent JPEG Group Internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie ",comp.graphics

I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday. They had advertised that they were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the room of the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went to the lecture.  There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one woman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of them. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium Rosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read straight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he lacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy read, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars (English?) from the thirteenth century.  The other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a fairy-tale teller's voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to me. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something. What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity, then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently, but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I've read too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks about in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your friends_ in _Prometheus rising_.   It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding the actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to be a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more distance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain power and admiration.

The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as officers and yelling ""Police"" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug houses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it's a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so commonly, now would it?  Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my point, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear judgement on this issue.  I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day. Furthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  Just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they reasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which can't be faked by the ""competition""?  Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not an excuse to murder police.

DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  ""Galactic Pot-Healer"" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  ""A Maze of Death"" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  ""VALIS"" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  ""The Divine Invasion"" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  ""The Handmaid's Tale"" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it ""right"" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  ""The Bible"" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.

Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff's ""What Great Men Think of Religion"" and Noyes' ""Views of Religion"". 490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.  RICHARD SWINBURNE  ""The Existence of God (Revised Edition)"", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""The Coherence of Theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""Faith and Reason"" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revised edition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  ""The Miracle of Theism"", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements for God"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A. HAUGHT  ""Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness"",  Prometheus Books Looks at religious persecution from ancient times to the present day -- and not only by Christians.

SMITH  ""Atheism: The Case Against God"", Prometheus Books Describes the positions of atheism, theism and agnosticism.  Reviews many  of the arguments used in favour of the existence of God.

I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due to thermal cycle stresses...)  I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are much less so.)

It's similar to collecting coins, or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model trains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about everything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it something of an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really; it's just a hobby.  The collector yearns for diversity (not much use in having TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical significance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance (this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first one to do it this way), rarity, and so on.  Some people use their collections, other people do not.  As you state, you use your collection.  In one sense, this diminishes the value of your collection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  In another sense, it can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  Some people collect firearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms they collect.  It's just personal preference.  Oops, 'personal preference' ... I guess we're not supposed to have that any more, are we?  J.Baker.  ",talk.religion.misc

Bill, I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism. Lack of  belief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding transcendental values. I hope you would accept the fact that  for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism.  I think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might  revise and fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems.  Cheers, Kent  --- sandvik@newton.apple.com.

I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little, which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and all peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.  I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was completely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.  I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc., all to no avail.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the ""death"" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the net about this because I already know what they'll say: ""Yep, you gotta have this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???.""  I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life cycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the brand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz. I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down before coming in to work today.  If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm not opposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely necessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu but if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days.  BTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feel free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and name of the FAQ if you don't mind.

I take it that you're expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:     Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not    only invited to participate in the deliberations of our ""founding    fathers,"" but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy    arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany    Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the    Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,    and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion    Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express    a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were    revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the    American psyche.    ...       By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the    Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited    forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors    on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged    his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at    Albany Congress: ""It would be a strange thing...if six nations    of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union    and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted    for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should    be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.""       According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs    and congressional delegates in order to ""hammer out a plan that he    acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.""  Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the American Nation_ addresses this issue. -- Doug Graham         dgraham@bnr.ca         My opinions are my own.

Or are the allegations just part of the Big > Cover-Up?  Thank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being a Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a conviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the ""fundy"" part as the term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and wish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it matter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been satisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling struggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.  With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you to re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume that defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his right to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh' theology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch- Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect of the tragic events of the past few days.  Nor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the federal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having ever been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least that's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa- gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might bring upon him.    But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the building in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse and none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with Davidians several times before the conflagration, reported that the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.  Ultimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh is quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all. So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One who has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the people it serves.  --Joe Gaut  >  > (I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I wouldn't > put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.

For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  ""The            demonstration that no possible combination of known            substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of            force, can be united in a practical machine by which man            shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer            as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any            physical fact to be.""                            Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright            Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final            word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they            crash).                            Today, orthodox physicists and other ""scientists"" are            saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy'            Technologies, using negative terms such as ""pseudo-science""            and ""perpetual motion"", and citing so-called ""laws"" which            assert that ""energy cannot be created or destroyed"" (""1st law            of thermodynamics"") and ""there is always a decrease in useful            energy"" (""2nd law of thermodynamics"").  The physicists do not            know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare            that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF            IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern ""science"" and help to            cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox            modern theories.                            Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a            seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-           OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT            SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated            pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment.                            Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy,            but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by            various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices,            they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they            can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy            has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by            clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced            by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and            high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and            often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are            suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly            designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations.                            For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058,            #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for            motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly            tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic            field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to            be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in            ""Science & Mechanics"" magazine, Spring 1980, (""Amazing            Magnet-Powered Motor"", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117,            and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes,            orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such            a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible            heatpump in one's home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.  [Complete            descriptive copies of U.S. patents are $3.00 each from the            U.S. Patent Office, 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA             22202; correct 7-digit patent number required.  Or try            getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your            local public or university library's inter-library loan            dept..]                            A second type of free-energy device, such as the 'Gray            Motor' (U.S. Patent #3,890,548), the 'Tesla Coil', and the            motor of inventor Joseph Newman [see SCIENCE, 2-10-84, pages            571-2.], taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from            'EARTH RESONANCE' (about 12 cycles per second plus            harmonics).  They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit            which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the            energy being tapped.  It is important that the total            'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to            'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in            order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be            increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER'            of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a            Tesla Coil, slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the            secondary coil will enhance output power.  [""Earth Energy:            Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems"", by John Bigelow, 1976,            Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.]                            During the 1930's, an Austrian civil engineer named            Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an            'IMPLOSION TURBINE' (German name, 'ZOKWENDLE'), after            analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped            waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical            equations to explain it.  As described in the book ""A            Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources"", by Dan A. Davidson,            1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a            LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a            CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer            touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump,            which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC            GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that            of the earth's rotation, via the 'Coriolis effect', LIKE A            TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ]                            A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock            Air Motor' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between            a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression            ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and            planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running            by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also            generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat            buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large            trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.             [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the            automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.]                            Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown            in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between            metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of            particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a            common household smoke detector.                            One other energy source should be mentioned here,            despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free            Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph            Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION            reactor which he calls 'Migma', which uses NON-radioactive            deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities            from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be            converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting            steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power            a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the            ""Tokamaks"" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about,            Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power            for every watt put in.  [""New Times"" (U.S. version), 6-26-78,            pages 32-40.]                            And then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that            have been in the news lately, originally conducted by            University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin            Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake            Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of            chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the            bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with            mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which            PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough            of it to explain the excess heat generated.                            There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called ""laws""            of thermodynamics are NOT so ""absolute"".  For example, the            late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the 'Reciprocal System', (which he describes in detail            in several books such as ""Nothing But Motion"" (1979) and ""The            Universe of Motion"" (1984)), in which the physical universe            has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter            half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing            between them, with-OUT the ""heat death"" predicted by            thermodynamic ""laws"".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH            BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena            that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some            Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow,            seemingly converting ""low-quality energy"" into ""high-quality            energy"".                            Also, certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat'            and 'Eckankar' teach their Members that the physical universe            is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of            existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV            channels, as described in books like ""The Path of the            Masters"", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and ""Eckankar: The Key            to Secret Worlds"", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example,            the next level up from the physical universe is commonly            called the 'Astral Plane'.  Long-time Members of these groups            have learned to 'Soul Travel' into these higher worlds and            report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy            could flow down from these higher levels into the physical            universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given            the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is            supported by many successful laboratory-controlled            experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as            those described in the book ""Psychic Discoveries Behind the            Iron Curtain"".                            In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors            do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop            and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional            energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their            VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If            the government does not intervene, then the total supply of            energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and            will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and            pollution and its harmful effects (including the 'GREENHOUSE            EFFECT', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil            spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue            to increase.                            The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development            of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize            private production (until the producers can make it on their            own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of            Free Energy Hardware.                            The long-range effects of such government intervention            would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy            demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining            companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$,            etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to            seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil,            and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for            conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero,            while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high            but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR's,            personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that            require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease,            along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be            able to realize the ""opportunity costs"" of paying electric            utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would            benefit and increase because travelers would not have to            spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government            tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be            obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE            USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR.                            Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of            business, but society as a whole, and the earth's environment            and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People,            that government should serve, rather than the big            corporation$ and bank$.

Is anyone in the same  situation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this?  We've  taken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting  anything get bottled up inside.  Sometimes I get the feeling we're making this  much bigger than it actually is.

You assume that the general public ""can't handle the truth"" and then, based on this  assumption, go for the fluff arguments.

Well, yes.  This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories.  There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is obscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to copy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same ""errors"".  This would appear to tell us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we don't know what they did before that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the point at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (and in some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for the most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.  You're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Some people like to use the game of ""telephone"" as a metaphor for the transmission of the texts.  This clearly wrong.  The texts are transmitted accurately. --  C.

This is my own  guess, based on similar designs flown on other large STS-launched s/c  (GRO, UARS).  Also, there _might_ be some consideration given to mass  requirements (bi-stems weight less than conventional S/A).  Finally,  the HST arrays _do_ have the ability to be detached--remember, they're  going to be replaced with new arrays.  However, as an ACS guy who's seen his branch management pull their collective hair out over HST, I would voice a hearty 'yea' to using conventional arrays over bi-stems, whenever possible.

"From: bobbe@vice (Robert Beauchaine;6086;59-323;LP=A;YAyG) Subject: More Best of A.A Lines: 164    			RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992  		WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE  I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC  	Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your  only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the  Tribulation.  ""But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be  saved."" - Matthew 24:13  II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION  	The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as ""the time of Jacob's (Israel's) trouble"" (Jere 30:7) and ""Daniel's Seventieth Week"" (Dan 9), this  period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.  III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM  	Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community  (the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable  possession during the Tribulation.  IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  	Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24,  Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you.    V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  	Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray  and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual  strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ.    VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS  	After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell, or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be useless.  ""And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and  slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast,  or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666"" - Revelation 13:16-18.   	The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of  humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past, such as the Holocaust. [or maybe the crusades? -M] You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) ""...I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of  them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer,  until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed."" Revelation 6:9, 11. 	His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ ""...And I saw the souls of  those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of  God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands."" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children,  torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark.   	If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however, you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire. [Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M] You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake of Fire.  ""...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his  mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His  indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the  presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."" -Revelation  14:9-10   [and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium --M]   VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL  	Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is  important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake. 	The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay  attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation. [""As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school closings"" --M]  Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood. [Get a good water filter. --M] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights, batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to  survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.  VIII. TRUST NO ONE 	 	There will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's government.  Be on the lookout. [Perot supporters take note --M]  IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST  	It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to, for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel  11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be  physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and  personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which he will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural  power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived. [Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M] 	The antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.   All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.  X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!  	The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you  will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.   	Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of  your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take the mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or remain saved, but this time you will have to be ""faithful unto death.""

Lines: 46 Nntp-Posting-Host: acad3.alaska.edu Organization: University of Alaska Fairbanks     A great many computer programmers read ""Dr. Dobb's Journal"".  In a recent issue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It said:    ""There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's.""    Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the ""cracker"" ethic, which is something entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks, crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely ignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves hackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so for a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller than it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the 286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.      That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud it; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the problem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.    I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists, where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves ""hackers"" allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative, interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry?

Lines: 169  Brian Ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of False Dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to Peter, or we must discount every other book of antiquity:  >>(1) Peter died two millenia ago.  The original letters he wrote have >>long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could >  > Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III, > Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?   Their documents > have decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse?   Mr Ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every ""historical"" document.  Somehow I doubt do that yourself that.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical document, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to Peter.   I shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you reject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by Matthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were carved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather than mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285 BC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo).  The Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much single-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops.   Note that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person.  The following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume II.  	My majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall 	on their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into 	the water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin; 	I attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and 	my chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking 	back.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors 	me, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth, 	in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.  (Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses ""divine word,"" but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of  battle.)  	Then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces 	of the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other 	with him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and 	found 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...  	No officer was with me, no charioteer, 	No soldier of the army, no shield-bearer; 	My infantry, my chariotry yielded before them, 	Not one of them stood firm to fight with them. 	His majesty spoke: ""What is this, father Amun? 	Is it right for a father to ignore his son? 	Are my deeds a matter for you to ignore? 	Do I not walk and stand at your word? 	I have not neglected an order you gave. 	Too great is he, the great lord of Egypt, 	To allow aliens to step on his path! 	What are these Asiatics to you, O Amun, 	The wretches ignorant of god? 	Have I not made for you many great monuments, 	... 	I call to you, my father Amun, 	I am among a host of strangers; 	All countries are arrayed against me, 	I am alone, there's none with me! 	... 	The labors of many people are nothing, 	Amun is more helpful than they; 	I came here by the command of your mouth, 	O Amun, I have not transgressed your command!""  	Now though I prayed in a distant land, 	My voice resounded in Southern Thebes. 	I found Amun came when I called to him, 	He gave me his hand and I rejoiced. 	He called from behind as if near by: 	""Forward, I am with you, 	I your father, my hand is with you, 	I prevail over a hundred thousand men, 	I am lord of victory, lover of valor!"" 	I found my heart stout, my breast in joy, 	All I did succeeded, I was like Mont. 	... 	I slaughtered among them at my will, 	Not one looked behind him, 	Not one turned around, 	Whoever fell down did not rise. 	... 	One called out to the other saying: 	""No man is he who is among us, 	It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person; 	Not deeds of man are these his doings, 	They are of one who is unique, 	Who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots, 	Come quick, flee before him, 	To seek life and breathe air; 	For he who attempts to get close to him, 	His hands, all his limbs grow limp. 	One cannot hold either bow or spears, 	When one sees him come racing along!"" 	My majesty hunted them like a griffin, 	I slaughtered among them unceasingly.  So you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous  battle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being *completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own words:       ""question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,      Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?""  Do you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your ""all or nothing"" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy with their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter (and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all, forces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find completely credible.   As to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he must be true:  > Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness?  > Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from > shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer > programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near > complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that > that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious > display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than > King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln?   I have three points.    First, this is ""argumentum ad populum"" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you cannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and present who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for the existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to the testimony of Hindus:  	""With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of  	 the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete  	 hooey?""  If you do so ""scoff,"" then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading?  Second, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to Jesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true.   Third, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that he had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was much discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a deist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've previously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc.    				Later,  				Dave Butler      ""My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of       salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become       clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for       thinking I shall ever change them.""

In order for U.S.  industries to >compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't >has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)  This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII. The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary.  During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they  were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is probably because of the ""research mind"" approach, which is not to try to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems, the job got done.  The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as  NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations, making it more difficult for them to act to support research.  The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding, and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose, as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask for one?  The answer I will get is, ""Get the money from NSF.""  Now the money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects get supported, and how much.    Also, the government decided that the ""wealth"" should be spread.  So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find  impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast,  and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring  more than minimal attention of a good researcher.    I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders. --  Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399 Phone: (317)494-6054 hrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)   {purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP) ",sci.space

The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that they've reach any such conclusions.  He pointed out that under intense heat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard.

Well, there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of. The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase in animal diversity. Likewise, after the one-two punch of the Permian and Triassic extinctions, the number of marine animals rose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread  of humans.  (**) biggest exception being the K/T (bye bye dinos) extinction  (*) about 800 families  Also, plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in succesive sweeps. Mosses colonized very wet environments first, ferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory when they evolved (1). These were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms (pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). Fungi also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land.   (1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families) (2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families) (3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently)  It's unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number of species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this in the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) that diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions happen often enough to keep the total number down.  (***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented specific ecosystems were.   See Cowen's book ""History of Life"" for a not-too-technical run-down on, well, like the title sez, the history of life. Or see, Wilson's ""Diversity of Life"" for a view centered more on current ecology -- this is (IMHO) the best popular biology book of (what the hell, I'll say it) all time.   >							James Nicoll  Follow-ups to t.o.

I've admired both his paintings (remember the USPS Solar System Exploration Stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of spaceflight.  For several years he's been working on a *big* project which is almost ready to hit the streets.  A brochure from his publisher has landed in my mailbox, and I thought it was cool enough to type in part of it (it's rather long).  Especially given the Net's strong interest in vaporware spacecraft...                   ==================================                           The Dream Machines: An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature                              By Ron Miller                   with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke  Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne, Florida, USA Orig. Ed. 1993 Pre-publication $84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9   This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to reach them.     Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize differences, similarities, and influences.  This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship.  SPECIAL FEATURES  Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and fictional  Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA archives  An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, >even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.  I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least, our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the 'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal. I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that, just because it has changed the way we strive.  BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.

You have used the terms absolute, objective and others interchangeably. Same with moral values, values, at all, worth, measuers, and usefulness. You infer from them as if they were the same.   To the IF. When the If is not fulfilled, your intermission is a waste of time. Assuming that you don't intend this, it is reasonable to conclude that you want to argue a point.   You have made a interesting statement here, namely that of the disinterested observer. There is no such thing in morals. Probably the shortest proof for objective and morality being a contradiction.     >#For one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. Unlike >#a football.

An ""Islamic Bank"" is something which operates in a different fashion to your modern bank, as I have explained here (on another thread) before. For example, Islamic banks don't pay fixed interests on deposits, but a return on investments (which varies according to the market, and is not fixed like interest is).  Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world. There are no Islamic banks in ""the West"", including the USA, to my knowledge.  I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not while ""Islamic banks"" are at a relatively early stage of their development as is the case now.  BCCI is most certainly not an ""Islamic bank"" -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  If the answer to this question is ""yes"", then BCCI was not an Islamic bank, as Islamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.

Organization: Starfleet Headquarters: San Francisco Lines: 45  brian@lpl.arizona.edu (Brian Ceccarelli 602/621-9615) writes: > >So what is your beef against Jesus?  First and foremost, I honestly do not believe that Jesus was anything more than a man who lived and died two thousand years ago.  I know your Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did, but I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has any bearing on this universe or the lives in it, and I similarly do not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed.  Period.  I view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a 'cultural virus' that has been passed down from generation to generation because people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim responsibility for their own fate, so they brainwash themselves and their children into believing the popular myths, and it goes on from there.  And eventually Christianity becomes a given -- if so many other people believe in it, it must be right, no?  I don't believe in any ""life after death"".  I believe that when I die, I die, so therefore it's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose to my life in the meantime.  I don't believe that it's a good thing to humble myself and view pride as a sin -- pride, in moderation, is a constructive thing.  I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and nothing inferior about women, and my priests lost a lot of my trust when they patronizingly tried to explain the 'faults' of these opinions to me.  I don't believe in 'loving everyone', especially people I've never met; while I try to show respect to everyone, my love and admiration is something not easily earned, and I do not feel guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has abused it.  If you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously, stop trying to show me how the Bible ""makes sense"".  Start trying to show me that this Jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone's life here on Earth.  --  _/_/_/  Brian Kendig                             Je ne suis fait comme aucun /_/_/  bskendig@netcom.com                de ceux que j'ai vus; j'ose croire _/_/                            n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent.   /  The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre.  /    is that it ends.                                           -- Rousseau ",talk.religion.misc

Such things are derived from Biblcal texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.  You are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and this is alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comes to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs, there is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the doctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the texts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be. According to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.  Therefore, when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision and thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the Bible, people consider him a cult. ",talk.religion.misc

"From: iharkest@Lise.Unit.NO (Inge Harkestad) Subject: Tangent vectors of Kochanek-Bartels splines Organization: University of Trondheim Lines: 33  I'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  I'm using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84 proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between the key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form (x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when positioned at (x,y,z).  The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the positions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I've tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although the spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain - I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation error...)  Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors. I'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at   iharkest@lise.unit.no Anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of the replies if they contact me.  --   _________     __________________ \\        \\  \\  \\ N G E  \\==\\ A R K E S T A D     iharkest@lise.unit.no         Comp.

This is true in exactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in Zeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophies from many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same way as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts. Atheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians base theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.  The ""weak atheist"" position is logically extremely assailable -- any logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak atheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with attempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail miserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the ""strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist"" position do so on this basis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound; therefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do not exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are defined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of popular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite questionable.  --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry.  Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?  Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.  You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look rather odd.  So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:  >>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How >>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together?

But to add to this explaniation, each individual detector also has a built in fail-safe, just so the detector does not read the background radiation(i.e. cosmic rays),  if I remember right, the detectors go off about 3 to 5 sigma above the  background.

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture quality if your dithering works right).  I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to GIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards. You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+ computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a 8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way gives a brighter more detailed image.  Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as far as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)  Have a day!

I am doubting a claim presented without any evidence to support it.  If you are able to present real evidence for it, then great.

You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy undergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)  However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago. ( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )  I suppose that the ""right"" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration, but it is a worthwhile one.

I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a ""rosicrucian"" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean ""members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian"". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)   Response:  This makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions. There is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people who call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually *BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important requirements about not belonging to other 'religions'.  I find that the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that 'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'Perennial Philosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>   Tony:  I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I looked). Of course, ""most members"" does not *necessarily* mean ""best"".   Response:  Certainly true.  I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves 'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC.  Sure, I've heard all the hubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these Western esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'. I'll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>   Tony:  ""You'll have to trust me"" when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO.    Response:  This may be slightly off.  I've met some of these Rosicrucians and have a couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I've heard and the slight contact I've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received with any kind of warm welcome.  I still like to think that most people who are involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.) are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'.

For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not.  The 'spaceport political publicity' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project.

Let's see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.  Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning. I could go on with these examples for a long time....  Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks, and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized,  imprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be free from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was  good for them.  I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority, is immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in his/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all common sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. This is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people  by logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have equal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and medical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of beauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.  Have you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people? The sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail than you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.  Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution you have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole life, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see squalor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live for?    I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both. I, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living. That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.

I've heard that to the extent there is a division of modern philosophy between the ""Continental"" and British/American schools, Rand belongs in the former in terms of methodology et al, even though she was trying to say things that would belong in the latter school.

We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit, and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.  So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway, and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place.  Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image.   >>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How >>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global >>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and >>>much more complicated.  Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way, jumps off the discussion a bit.  My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.   About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the mentioned type images.  Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that.  Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen...   >Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?  It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that. Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say, person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error.  I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design.  So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.  Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where 'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem. (Americans: the lift is just an example :)   Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to read it.   Juhana Kouhia ",comp.graphics

Not in gamma rays, though.  You'd hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc, but if a decent fraction of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic  (but closer than 9 Mpc).  I dunno SN theory so well, but I can't think of how to get many gammas out.  Maybe I should look it up.  Big radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*.  That's just in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but ""bursts""? Nah.  Neither of these should be taken as explanations... just trying to show that those energies *are* produced by things we know about.   greg     ",sci.space

So .. ?  So nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesn't give any insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.

Well, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there was a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural diety who wants us to live a certain way.

The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily documented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and that is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or one's ignorance.  Someone else will address this I'm sure, and refer you to plenty of documentation...  >As much > as anything else you learn.

Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge.  If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my enkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will ""feel"" right, and I will trust without knowing).  Maybe.  Religosity does not seem to be anything that is conclusively arrived at, but rather it seems to be more of a sudden affliction... I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed, many of us were not.  The question is, is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or healthy morality.  IT would seem not to be.

Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the world is flat.  However, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in  voluntarly actions. I don't think Plato would have been happy with this, and neither would Paul, although Paul's ideas were quite different.

The same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature.

I have read a few articles about this and know  that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both   ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists  public domain source code for this.      Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting  which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces  consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used (M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. ""Ray-casting and block model conversion using a spatial index"". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65). But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ? I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed this is already the case.      I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden line removal. It says ""if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing  toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra..."". Again how to make sure ?      Any pointers are welcome ?

I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue. Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination, grasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme suffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to diminished mental capacity.  At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness. He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years. After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don't say it couldn't happen to you, or that it hasn't happened to others, even if you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this. People are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness in that instance. I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness.  Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may well be untrue. In any case they are not evidence for anything besides the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.

You got me thinking now!  This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a  move in society to classify previously ""socially unacceptable"" yet legal  activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two  coexisting methods of social control.  First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of  actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set  of punishments.  Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are  the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered  by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if  socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed  since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of  social censure.  The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as ""guilt"" and  ""morality"".  I've heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren't for  the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be  absolutely impossible.  Lately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to  attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain't  illegal, then don't pick on me).  I'm not saying this is wrong, merely  that it is a byproduct of a society which has:  	1) A high education level, 	2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media, 	3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and 	4) A ""me"" oriented culture.  I guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition,  here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\ can't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we  are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as  those freedoms don't impinge on another's.  IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we  appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old  territoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized,  inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the  continued destabilization of society.    I got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this  mess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms  in order to ""stabilize"" society.  Yet I believe development of societies  follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a  social model which maximizes indiv. freed.'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is  possible to live with a ""non-stable"" society?  Anybody see a way out?  Comments?  PS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don't.  Do we want to?

Yes.  Here's what you should do.  Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay, but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each vertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertex more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have to be transformed at all.  Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hither plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.

In an increasingly litigation mad society, this trap is becoming exceedingly difficult to avoid. With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures in American (and Australian, to bring in my local perspective) culture the boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may eventually become the definition of moral behaviour. For instance, some cultures' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals. Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. However, is it moral, according to the multicultural american society? This kind of problem may only be definable by legislation.   Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is acceptable behaviour or not, and much of this will be due to different environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions.    One thing is for sure, there is no universal moral code which will suit all cultures in all situations.  There may, however, be some globally accepted mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable concept. The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon this earth are living in a similar environment (if that ever happens).  Jeff 'Nonickname' Clark.  ",alt.atheism

Jesus doesn't view guilt like our modern venacular colors it.     ""Feelings"" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of  being guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a  reaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the  reaction.   Let me give you an example:  Have you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a little white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really  didn't know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish? Are you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You are guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.   Feelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus's use of the word ""guilt"" as how a court uses it.  Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do bad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our  guilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things.  We are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is not a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human being.  Guilty as charged.  > and then there's this single personality that will save you from this > universal guilt feeling.  You can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you made a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in the meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the way Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.  Or two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself and feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to say a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way  Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this  category to some extent in their lives.  Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt feeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That isn't new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize  that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him. That is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to  have your company.  You are immensely valuable to him. Jesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present sinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.    God is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into a round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him. God has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in Jesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will move it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very being--and us and God communicate with each through his unifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For with the divine nature living within us, we can now see our imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With the power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives  within us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before we could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now  have authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine  nature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit is eternal.  The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God. Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he separated the ""goats from the sheep"".   Many people in the last day will ask him, ""Didn't I prophesy in your name and do miracles, and do good things in your name?""   And what did Jesus say? ""Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.""  That is the cornerstone of  Christianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your  relationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.    > Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all, > I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this > huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.  Good.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you love yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus taught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before,  in the common english venacular, ""feeling guilty"" has a different meaning than the state of guilt.  > This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain > personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain > religious doctrines. And if your personality type is  > opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain > world view system.  I believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego, a lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.  > There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice > thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden, > the shoulders feel far more relaxed!  Yes.  You have stated what Jesus said.  Remember?  ""Come to me, take my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light.""  A yoke is used to direct oxen to do work.  Once you have a relationship with  Jesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life.  Having  God at your side is of great advantage. ",talk.religion.misc

Rick, I think we can safely say, 1) Robert is not the only person who understands the Bible, and 2), the leadership of the LDS church historicly never has.  Let's consider some ""personal interpretations"" and see how much trust we should put in ""Orthodox Mormonism"", which could never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.          In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie said they ""thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Messiah."" He also said Christians are wrong to believe ""that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity [God the Father],"" and that Christ ""came into mortality"" as His ""Only Begotten"" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter. He said that ""Elohim is the Father"" and ""Jehovah is the Son.""    ""Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists   have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise   to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to   identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the   promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the   Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As   with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the   Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy   Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was   born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.   (Promised Messiah, p. 100)          Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about their ""three-in-one God"" and their belief that ""God is a Spirit"" as they are in their understanding of who ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah"" are. Before examining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah."" McConkie stated:    ""...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in   the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the   exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)    ""_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted   name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his   supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon   Doctrine, p. 224)          Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah"" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:    ""_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus   Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn   Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,   Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)          ""A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve"" apostles of the Mormon Church states that ""God the Eternal Father...[is] designate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'..."" (Articles of Faith, p. 466) ""...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied state...was known as Jehovah..."" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)          Today Mormon leaders teach that ""Elohim"" in the OT refers to God the Father and ""Jehovah"" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians for saying ""Jehovah"" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two ""name-titles"" should not be changed around so that Christ is called ""Elohim"" and the Father is called ""Jehovah."" ""...the Father...is Elohim, not Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one and the same person."" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)          In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word ""Elohim"" is used to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges of Israel. When referring to the true God, ""Elohim"" is translated with a capital ""G."" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel, it is translated with a small ""g."" It is translated four times as ""judges"" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as ""judge"" (1 Sam. 2:25), twice as ""mighty"" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as ""angels"" (Ps. 8:5), once as ""godly"" (Mal. 2:15), once as ""great"" (Gen. 30:8), and once as ""very great."" (1 Sam. 14:15)          The word ""Jehovah"" is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word ""Adonai.""  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since ""Jehovah"" rather than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use ""Jehovah"" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of Mormon leaders regarding that name. ""Jehovah,"" unlike ""Elohim,"" is never used of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the Bible. In the KJV, ""Jehovah"" is rendered primarily ""LORD,"" sometimes ""GOD,"" and rarely ""Lord.""          Now that we understand something about the words ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah"" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle McConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is ""Jehovah."" In trying to prove that ""Jehovah"" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie cited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right. Remember, McConkie said the Father is not ""Jehovah;"" He is only ""Elohim."" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's interpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:    ""Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit   and he testified, ""The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right   hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"" (Ps. 110:1.) Two   Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater   than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of   the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this   Messianic prophecy?   ""What think ye of Christ?"" our Lord asked certain of his detractors   toward the end of his mortal ministry. ""Whose son is he?"" Is Christ   the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent   or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he   was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the   Jews. And so they answered, ""The Son of David.""   David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our   Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,   asked, ""How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord   said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine   enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his   son?"" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the   great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him   as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake   unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is   interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The   Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my   right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up   to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to   sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)   (emphasis added)          Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6 reads: ""The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the Son]..."" (brackets in original)          McConkie clearly stated that it is ""Elohim"" the Father who is speaking to ""Jehovah"" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at the Hebrew word translated ""LORD,"" it becomes apparent that either the first ""LORD"" is not the Father or else the Father is ""Jehovah."" Either way McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:    ""The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right   hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)          The first ""LORD"" in this verse is ""Jehovah"" who Mormonism says is Christ, not the Father. The second ""Lord"" is the Hebrew word ""Adon"" (singular for ""Adonai,"" meaning master or lord). If the first ""LORD"" is the Father and the second ""Lord"" is the Son, then the Father is ""Jehovah"" and the Son is ""Adon."" However, if the Father is not ""Jehovah"" as McConkie claimed, then the first ""LORD"" is ""Jehovah"" the Son, but who, then, is ""Adon?"" Obviously the Father is ""Jehovah"" in this Psalm, and His Son is ""Adon.""          Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated the following:    ""I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,"" _Isaiah quoted the   Father as saying of Christ_, ""and will hold thine hand, and will keep   thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the   Gentiles."" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)          McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage which reads:    ""I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold   thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the   people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)          According to McConkie, ""I the LORD"" refers to the Father, and ""thine"" and ""thee"" refer to Christ. However, the ""LORD"" who is speaking is ""Jehovah"" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the Father is ""Jehovah.""          Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie stated:    ""The same Psalm says: ""All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they   shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord   that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in   him."" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is   found in these words: ""The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes   and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be   the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will   believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will   have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which   were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth."" (Matt.   27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)          Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:    ""All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they   shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would   deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.          McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment ""as Jesus hung on the cross."" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was Christ. Who, then, was the ""LORD"" in whom he trusted? It was ""Jehovah"" the Father.          Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them, McConkie stated the following:    ""With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our   Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: ""They took counsel   together against me, they devised to take away my life."" (Ps. 31:13.)   As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:   ""Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my   bread, hath lifted up his heel against me."" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised   Messiah, p. 532)          Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's ""arrest and judicial trials."" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter.    ""For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while   they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my   life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God   [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)          McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes on to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the ""LORD"" who is called His ""God"" or ""Elohim."" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is ""Elohim"" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the ""Elohim"" of the man Jesus is ""Jehovah"" the Father.          In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses will be considered in this examination.    ""Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my   bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.   But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that   I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)          McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in Christ's death. Since it was Judas who was the ""familiar friend"" who ""lifted up his heel,"" the pronouns ""mine,"" ""I,"" ""my,"" and ""me"" in verse 9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there is a change of pronoun to ""thou,"" which refers to the ""LORD"" (Jehovah). Then the pronouns ""me"" and ""I"" which refer to Christ are used again. That means Christ was speaking to ""Jehovah"" the Father in these verses.          Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.         110:4.    ""One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,   says: ""The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for   ever after the order of Melchizedek."" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,   p. 450)          McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ. The question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?    ""The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest   for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)          Does the ""LORD,"" which is ""Jehovah,"" refer to Christ? If McConkie is right and Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" but the Father is not, then the ""LORD"" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one addressed as the ""priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?"" The Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10; 6:20; 7); therefore, the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.          Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie stated:    ""Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...      The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....      It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)      (emphasis added)          McConkie rightly said these verses refer to ""the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah."" However, what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the Father is ""Jehovah."" Verse 6 reads: ""All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us all,"" and verse 10 reads: ""Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise him [Christ]...""          Obviously the ""LORD"" who laid on Christ ""the iniquity of us all"" and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called ""Jehovah"" in these verses.          Remember, McConkie stated that ""some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,"" and that Christ ""came into mortality"" as His ""Only Begotten"" Son. He called this concept ""misinformation"" that is ""untrue."" To prove that it is McConkie who is misinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam. 7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding these Scriptures:    ""In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of   the Seed of David: ""I will be his father, and he shall be my son."" (2   Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly   Messianic, occurs this statement: ""Thou art my Son; this day have I   begotten thee."" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in   Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the   Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)          McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7 refer to Christ who ""would come as the Son of God."" Since McConkie first referenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with verse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.    ""And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people   Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the   LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.   And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,   I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy   bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.   He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of   his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2   Sam. 7:11-14)          These verses teach that the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) would have a Son, the Messiah.         In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination will include verse 8. Notice that it is the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) who says, ""Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.""    ""I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou   art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.   Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,   and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.          McConkie said these verses of Scripture are ""clearly Messianic,"" and he acknowledged they teach that ""Christ would come as the Son of God."" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these Scriptures also teach that the Father is ""Jehovah"" and that the ""sectarians"" who believe ""Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son"" is Jesus Christ, ""the Only Begotten,"" are right in their belief.          Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated the following:    ""And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,   this is he of whom it is written_: ""He shall stand and feed in the   strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his   God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth."" (Mic.   5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)          According to McConkie, the pronoun ""He"" at the beginning of Mic. 5:4 refers to Christ ""during his mortal ministry."" Who, then, is the ""LORD his God?"" Mic. 5:4 reads:    ""And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD   [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God   [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.          Obviously the ""LORD"" of Jesus Christ is ""Jehovah"" the Father who is referred to as ""Jehovah his Elohim.""          Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses McConkie stated the following:    ""A number of Messianic passages speak of ""the Lord, and...his   anointed"" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated   and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus   applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. ""The   Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek"" (Isa.   61:1), and then saying: ""This day is this scripture fulfilled in your   ears"" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)          The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:    ""The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel   together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.          McConkie said the ""anointed"" one was Christ. If that is true, who was ""Jehovah?"" If ""Jehovah"" is always Christ, who was the ""anointed"" one? Obviously ""Jehovah"" is referring to God the Father and the ""anointed"" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie cited is Isa. 61:1 which states:    ""The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the   LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;   he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to   the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;          The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open was Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse says the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same problem. If ""Jehovah"" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ, then Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, ""Jesus applied these passages to himself."" Therefore, the ""Jehovah"" who anointed Christ is God the Father.          Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not ""Jehovah."" However, these should be enough to expose their error.          Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" but He is not ""Elohim?"" It is true that Jesus is ""Jehovah."" The following Scriptures prove this fact:    ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer   the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and   beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)   [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and   was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)    ""...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have   pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only   son... (Zech. 12:1,10)   Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,   and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)    ""...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.   43:3)   ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)    ""And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of   the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)   ""...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name   under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)    ""Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his   reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)   ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.   22:12)    ""...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with   thee. (Zech. 14:5)   ""...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

(Ezek. 34:15-16)   ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.   (Luke 19:10)    ""For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy   Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)   Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great   God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and   Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;   Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and   Rev. 3:19)          While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" they are wrong when they say He is not ""Elohim."" The Bible reveals that ""Jehovah"" is the only true ""Elohim"" there is; all others are false. Remember, ""Jehovah"" is the personal name of the triune God who has revealed Himself in the Bible.          Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that ""Jehovah"" and ""Elohim"" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as ""Jehovah"" and ""Elohim"" but so is the Holy Spirit.    ""Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I   will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my   laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And   their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)   (emphasis on ""Holy Ghost"" and ""said"" added)   Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a   new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...   I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;   and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will   forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.   31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)    ""For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy   men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)   (emphasis on ""Holy Ghost"" added)   ""The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in   my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)          Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that ""Jehovah"" and ""Elohim"" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.    ""And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,   God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,   Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie   acknowledged that ""it was"" Christ's ""voice that spoke to Moses in the   burning bush..."" Promised Messiah, p. 394]   And the LORD [Jehovah] said...   And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the   children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your   fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his   name? what shall I say unto them?   And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus   shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto   you.   And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto   the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your   fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and   the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for   ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod.   3:4,7,13-15)    ""And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD   [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2)    ""I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God   [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:   (Isa. 45:5)    ""But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God   [Elohim], and an everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10)    ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer   the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and   beside me there is no God [Elohim]. (Isa. 44:6)    ""Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,   saith the LORD [Jehovah], whose name is The God [Elohim] of hosts.   (Amos 5:27)    ""Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's   [Jehovah's] thy God [Elohim], the earth also, with all that therein   is. (Deut. 10:14)    ""Wherefore thou art great, O LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim]: for there is   none like thee, neither is there any God [Elohim] beside thee,   according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 Sam. 7:22)    ""And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD [Jehovah],   the God [Elohim] of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.   (Jon. 1:9)    ""For who is God [Elohim] save the LORD [Jehovah]? or who is a rock   save our God [Elohim]? (Ps. 18:31)    ""Blessed is the nation whose God [Elohim] is the LORD [Jehovah]...   (Ps. 33:12. See also Ps. 144:15)    ""Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God   [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah], the Creator of the ends of the earth,   fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his   understanding. (Isa. 40:28)    ""The mighty God [Elohim], even the LORD [Jehovah], hath spoken, and   called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down   thereof. (Ps. 50:1)    ""Sing unto God [Elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that   rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. (Ps.   68:4) [Regarding the word ""Jah,"" Bruce R. McConkie stated: ""Jah   (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all   of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel."" Mormon   Doctrine, p. 391]    ""And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from   Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose   name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that   dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 Sam. 6:2)    ""...the Great the Mighty God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, is   his name. (Jer. 32:18)    ""O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the   wind....   Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD   [Jehovah]....   That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most   high over all the earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18)          The Bible clearly teaches that ""Jehovah"" is ""Elohim."" In fact, He is the only ""Elohim"" there is. He is the ""true,"" the ""living,"" the ""mighty,"" the ""great,"" and the ""everlasting Elohim."" He is the ""Elohim"" of Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon. ""Jehovah's"" name is ""Elohim of hosts."" (Amos 5:27)          Not only is ""Jehovah,"" ""Elohim,"" but ""Elohim"" is ""Jehovah."" The Bible reveals that ""Elohim's"" name is ""Jah"" (Ps. 68:4), ""Jehovah"" (Ps. 83:18), and ""Jehovah of hosts."" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation whose ""Elohim"" is ""Jehovah"" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not the ""Jehovah"" and ""Elohim"" of the Mormons.          Another Mormon error regarding ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah"" is the belief that ""Elohim,"" not ""Jehovah,"" is the Father of all the spirits, including Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage, ""A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve"" apostles states that ""God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent of...the spirits of the human race."" (p. 466) This ""Doctrinal Exposition"" also states explicitly that ""Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth, for He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of Elohim."" (p. 473)          The Apostle Talmage stated that ""_Elohim_...is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_--"" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)          The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this matter: ""...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to placing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the Father himself became personally involved. All things were created by the Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the spirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned."" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)          Mormon leaders claim that ""Jehovah-Christ"" did not create either man's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon ""Elohim,"" who is the father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the truth about who created man.    ""And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,   Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all   flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also   16:20-23) (emphasis added)    ""...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth   the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within   him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)    ""...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)    ""For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for   the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have   made_....   ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on ""souls...I   have made"" added)    ""Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...   (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)    ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee   from the womb_.   I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)   (emphasis added)    ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...   I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)   (emphasis added)    ""...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...   Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD   [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.   4:32,35)    ""Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the   earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the   people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)    ""...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of   Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon   the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)          The Bible reveals that it is ""Jehovah"" who is the ""Elohim of the spirits of all flesh"" and ""of all flesh"" itself, that it was He who ""formed the spirit of man within him,"" that He ""made us this soul"" and ""formed us from the womb."" He did indeed ""create man.""          If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" then they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are right when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are wrong when they say he is not ""Jehovah.""          Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man, Mormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:    ""Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....   And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for   never has man believed in me as thou hast....   Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and   _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)   (emphasis added)    ""For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I   that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)    ""...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of   Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and   all things that in them are.   Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)          D&C, 93:10 states that ""the worlds were made by him [Christ]; _men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him."" (emphasis added)          Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving ""Jehovah"" and his creation is the belief that ""Jehovah"" had ""many"" pre-mortal spirits helping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.    ""That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by ""many of   the noble and great"" spirit children of the Father is evident from   Abraham's writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: ""We will   go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these   materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell."" (Abra.   3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,   Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other ""noble and   great"" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines   of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)          The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:    ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee   from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that   stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by   myself. (Isa. 44:24)    ""Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of   the sea. (Job 9:8)          ""Jehovah,"" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.          Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim,"" the Apostle McConkie stated: ""Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods."" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 224) He also stated that ""Jesus...is above all save the Father only."" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)          The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called gods is the triune God ""Jehovah.""    ""For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above   all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)    ""For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art   exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)    ""Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods   [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)          If Mormon leaders are right when they say ""Jehovah"" is god the son and ""Elohim"" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be teaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie clearly stated, Mormons believe ""Elohim"" the father, not ""Jehovah"" the son, is the ""God above all Gods"" -- that Jesus is above all except the father; yet the Bible teaches that ""Jehovah"" is above all ""Elohim.""          At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the following remark about praying to Jesus:    ""Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly   to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been   developed....   This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the   Father, and to him only....   ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;   it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With   the Lord, pp. 19-20)          McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the Mormons ""pray to the Father, not the Son..."" On p. 306 of the same book McConkie states that ""Christ [the Son] is Jehovah."" This is important to remember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to the Mormon Christ who is ""Jehovah,"" the Bible states repeatedly in the OT that people prayed to ""Jehovah,"" and He not only heard those prayers, but He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to ""Jehovah.""    ""In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my   God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came   before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)    ""And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy   supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this   house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine   eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)    ""And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our   supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD   [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)    ""O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to   the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who   desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)    ""And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this   prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before   the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his   hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)    ""He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed   unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)    ""Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God   [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy   tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)    ""I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I   said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and   thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.   For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when   thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)          Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the ""godly"" pray to ""Jehovah."" According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very one to whom McConkie said people should not pray.          The Bible reveals there is only one true ""Elohim,"" and His name is ""Jehovah."" All other ""Elohim"" are false. They are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true ""Elohim"" and idolatry.    ""For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to   be feared above all gods [Elohim].   For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD   [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)    ""Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)    ""Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods   [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)    ""And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God   [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and   worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely   perish. (Deut. 8:19)    ""Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].   They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:   for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto   thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)    ""Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn   aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)    ""That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;   neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to   swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.   (Josh. 23:7)    ""...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)    ""But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God   [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)    ""And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,   which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods   [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about   them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]   to anger. (Jud. 2:12)    ""Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods   [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I   will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know   that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)    ""And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you   this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your   fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods   [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my   house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].   And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should   forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.   24:15-16)          These verses teach that the only true, living ""Elohim"" in heaven and on earth is ""Jehovah"" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth and all therein.          ""Jehovah"" is greater than any ""Elohim,"" because all other ""Elohim"" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17) ""Jehovah Elohim"" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false ""Elohim."" He told His people not to have any ""Elohim"" but Him. He told the people that if they left Him for the false ""Elohim,"" those ""Elohim"" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and would perish. He warned the people to ""take heed"" that their ""heart be not deceived"" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making covenants with false ""Elohim."" ""Jehovah Elohim"" told His people He would eventually judge all false ""Elohim"" and their followers.          Despite these warnings and guidelines, ""Elohim's"" covenant people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false ""Elohim's"" of the people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that ""the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods [Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim] of the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.""          This examination has shown that the ""Elohim"" of Mormonism, like the ""Elohim"" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true ""Jehovah Elohim."" Therefore, the people who leave the true ""Elohim"" for the Mormon ""Elohim"" will do ""evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].""          Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father [Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is triune; He is Spirit; He is ""Jehovah;"" and He did send His Son into the world to redeem mankind.          It is obvious from this examination that it is not the Christians who ""thrash around in...darkness"" about who ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah"" are. One wonders what ""Holy Writ"" McConkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that ""Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son."" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one ""Jehovah Elohim."" He apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses 1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as ""Jehovah.""  Summary          Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons ""have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God"" (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true God as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against God and idolatry.          In answer to Jesus' question, ""But whom say ye that I am,"" Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in the Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in the Mormon Jesus is believing in ""another Jesus"" whom Paul warned about.          Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy, admitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that ""it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."" (p. 26)          The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing adultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore, they do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: ""Salvation comes only by worshiping the true God."" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also rightly stated that ""the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living God,"" because the ""true names of Deity"" can be applied to ""false concepts of God."" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle Stephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave ""a new conception of God and the Godhead."" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p. 1)          It is important for the people who have left the true triune God revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.

No, they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society.  Even if they do that is *MANY YEARS* in the future--until which they are a burden on someone, or society.

Ok, look.  It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will take choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice C.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd have to pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they take choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next 18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen not to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid for for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in conscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly legal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded but some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those women who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice B or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see any reason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing personal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is what the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that* is what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A, and that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your ""taxes"" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being *lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your objections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down, as I'm sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in that area can help out in another--like our massive debt.)   >>If you disagree then give us some ""reasons"".  Given that abortion is >>*LEGAL* and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the >>population ... >>...it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford >>them, who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you >>would force upon them.

Uncle Bill doesn't pay for  >breast augmentation, facelifts, etc...  Why abortions?  It's elective  >surgery!    Those other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savings in other procedures that would be required down the road without them. (In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.) This is quite different from the case of abortion.  >As for your argument, you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making  >it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too, SO YOU  >ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS!  Think about  >it.  A poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded, what's she  >gonna do.  What choice have YOUR PLANS given her.  Your kind of double- >talk really makes me ill.  This is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing ""to make the alternative affordable too"".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then* your statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn't. If Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left it out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also be quite surprised.   >""Pro-choice"".  Ha!  Pro-Abortion really fits in your case.  Yes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.  >If you're gonna fund one choice, you have to fund them all, at the very  >least.

Your humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is still the fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young woman could need to be getting an education.

Kevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little about, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the lines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannot be algorithmic in his book _The emperor's new mind: Concerning computers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose's claim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look, could be just illusions.  We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective, realising that it might not be anything special, but certainly useful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds or not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave  just like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a ""total synthesis of C. elegans"" from the elements. Would such a worm have a mind?  > Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They're > great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not > at working out the method itself.  This is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains work like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence (Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less chaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve. Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.  > the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does > this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already > pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that > our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic > material, much of which isn't used.  Indeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms.   Kevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again. I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind are neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not  flame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are conscious.   The reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.  And please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn't.  > The other problem with algorithms is their instability.

Also, > neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate - > can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's > code?  Again, _brains are not computers_. Don't forget this. This does not mean they need something else to work - they just work differently. Their primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action,  self-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.  > The next problem is the sticky question of ""What is colour?"" (replace > 'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the > materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of > chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy + > different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these?  You are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in our brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is not how I see it. The sensation 'green' is a certain time-dependent pattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed with the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain.   Indeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns, but this is just idle speculation.  Scientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue on mind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-) There are two articles on visual perception, so you might be  interested.  But again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be  observed from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but  neuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the mind.  Kalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the  patients' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area was stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.  Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing situations, when the patients have started flirting with the therapist.  In conclusion, there is evidence that  1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences,     brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage  2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in    various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our    visual cortex is activated etc.  3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our    actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead    of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms.   Thus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question ""Why do 'I' see colours"" around and ask ""What is this 'I' that seems to be  observing?"", since it seems that our conscious mind is not the king of our brains.  > If this is so, a > computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an > algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an > equivalent that doesn't?

Does a neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?  If you are asking, ""why does an animal who is conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who doesn't"", I have a good answer - read my previous posting, where I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap roles and act more morally, so that they don't unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme, but this is the basic idea.)  When early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools,  a sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in line with this development. Indeed, respect for others and  conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals, such as early humans.   > If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction, > with two processes acting on it.

If minds are required for this, does this mean that until human minds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained in the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.

From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume it was tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up. Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.  The material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, say the linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.  What the space program did was to find a way to get it to stick.

The other x three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the  resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of  the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the  differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors. Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to determine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small  component to the positional error.    Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would  require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort  cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together  now: ""Parallax ARc SECond"", a parsec is the distance of an object  that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line). If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to  have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.  The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.  -Kevin ",sci.space

I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that we did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.   This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are usually more complex than this example I will use here.         Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds, its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.         Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the galaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a R=8800Mpc.           We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the old standby formula:                         Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak         For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec. And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call moderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second?                                                  -jeremy    ",sci.space

I have had >a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results. >Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?   Certainly. Reference follows.   Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.  The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina. It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected.  Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.  On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this point. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31  Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.  So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?  This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.  *So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or duuteranopia:  1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram 2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point 3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line 4) This is the new chromaticity.   The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour defective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 8(5) 28-40.  You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.  >I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow >previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour >blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!  Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a couple of weeks ago.  The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a help here.)  A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor data. B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v' using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z) C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above D) find the intersection as in step 3 E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and white) until it is displayable.  >Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is >sufficient interest  Done; also posted for the rest of us.  -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road,  Manchester, UK.

In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live according to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god make that desicion?

Well, I didn't ask to be created.   Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature (which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?

Pat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse.    Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's less than eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain and reschedule the EVA's in that time.  More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.   According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and AXAF.

I'm worried by the concern about it though, for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with Space Advertising (which for a number of reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds).  (And I've been reading and (and writing) this thread since way back when it was only on sci.space).  For starters, I don't think the piece of light-pollution apparatus would be as bright as the full moon. _That_ seems to me to be a bit of propaganda on the part of opponents, or wishful thinking on the part of proponents.  Second, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been levelled against other projects, that either 1) don't increace light pollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the target area.  You may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites. I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math, showing that SPS's weren't that bright after all, ending some two months of frenzied opposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types.  #2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested recently.  While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out that any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be concerned, and something any project like that would work against anyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there's going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll find many activists in Murmansk demanding the ""natural"" sky back. If anything, he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp, making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the ""day.""  The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass advertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one of those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't have lived without before.

Sorry, Fred, but for the purposes under discussion here, I must disagree.  Your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue against communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires, since those did not represent *true* communism.  In judging the practical consequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today, it is precisely the Khomeini's of the world, the Rushdie-fatwa supporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the world Muslim community to those extremists, that we must look to.  Perhaps unfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned with whether Islam is the right religion for them, or whether the Qur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but how Islam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be like if Islam gains in influence.  When I consider such possibilities, it is with not inconsiderable fear. --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

So I asked him, ""So what is this Higher Logic?""  His answer, ""I don't know.""  This, & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about xtainity.  It is abundantly clear to both atheists & xtains that their believe is both illogical & irrational.  Their tactics, therefore: to disregard logic & rationality altogether.  Silly excuses such as the ones above and those such as, ""How can u trust science, science was invented by man!"", only goes to further show the weakness of their religion.  In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing, xtains never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses. They know it would be a fruitless act, given the irrational nature of their faith. They would wait until a person is in distress, then they would comfort him/her and addict them to their emotional opium.  Never in my life had I met a person who converted to xtainity coz it's ""reasonable"".

What I mean by ""compositing"" is, say I have a live video clip (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to composite a series of frames would be even better.  I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform this.  Help, please! ",comp.graphics

Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time.  A good reference on this might be: ""Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92- 0639)."" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane    The design (the concept is also called ""Beta"") as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support.  System design reliability is .9995.    Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage.    To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans, modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets, would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.    Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225. The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin, with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.      The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier, cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude ""In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self- ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable.""    >Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?    Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.    Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government's future space transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the ""4-2-3"" architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types, etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against the investment and risk of going to ""leap frog"" new technologies like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.    It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor     --- Maximus 2.01wb ",sci.space

I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in any Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word ""Rosicrucian"" in the  name of the organization. I only claim having done some ""homework"" :-)       This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems different, it's my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. Heck, English may be my second language! (And then again maybe not by now :-)       I proceed: > >I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at >least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday. >      Let's start with the name ""Rosicrucian"". I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a ""rosicrucian"" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean ""members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian"". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)       I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I looked). Of course, ""most members"" does not *necessarily* mean ""best"".       Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they descend (at least in part) from what was the ""Gold-und-Rosenkreuz"" (Golden and Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two ""Golden and Rosy Cross"", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with Masonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).       ""You'll have to trust me"" when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO.   >The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and >that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars >(English?) from the thirteenth century. >      Again, instead of R:s, it should be ""Lectorium Rosicrucianum"" :-). It is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non- sectarian*.       The Cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged the 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the 12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the worldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church's unseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northern Italy, then throughout the south of France.   >What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all >contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity, >then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently, >but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss.       I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with ""us containing something divine""... And yes I don't like phrases like ""eternal bliss"" either! :-)  >How to robotize people and brainwash... >      For a moment I thought you were referring to Madison Ave :-) (Madison avenue in New York City is where the most influential (read $$$) *commercial* advertising is produced here in the USA :-)  Peace,  Tony   BTW, I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you free of charge.

Most books and journal articles on the subject of            astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial            differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by            contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except            for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.             Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical            agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual            validity.                            Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor            of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State            University.  He developed the Theory described in his books            while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the            properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements            they contain.                            ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" describes the astrophysical            portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE,            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of            ""grand unified field theory"" that orthodox physicists and            astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two            postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of            space and time:                            (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME.                            (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                            From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a            COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic            particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the            concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with            translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-           vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was            able to match parts of his theoretical universe with            corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including            EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959            book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES,            several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They            are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And            when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation            ready for those also.                            As a result of his theory, which he called ""THE            RECIPROCAL SYSTEM"", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the            sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists,            including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter,            quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure),            ""nuclear"" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass            increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in            stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be            nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very            critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles,            solutions in principle, ""no other way"" declarations, etc.,            used to maintain them.                            ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" is divided into 31 chapters.             It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from            the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters,            which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that            accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in            from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy            formation from the MYTHICAL ""big bang"" is a big mystery to            orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life            cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and            solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of            SINGLE stars.                            Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according            to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have            been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies            and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT            (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME).                            Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against            observations that contradict their theories would find            Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an            OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY            BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the            plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray            telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from            ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any            visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional            coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray            bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER            HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the ""cosmic            sector"".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a            RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed            of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE            dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the            bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly            at random.                            Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from            books, journal articles, and leading physicists and            astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted            with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the            end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book            ""Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey"", by William K. Hartmann,            says, ""Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if            we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars            form.... Unfortunately we cannot.""  Larson's book contains            LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are            WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists,            astronomers, and astrophysicists.

I have no first hand, or even second hand, knowledge of how the  original apostles died.  If they began a myth in hopes of exploiting it for profit, and followed that myth to the death, that would be inconsistent.  Real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would  lead to discomfort, pain and death.  The story in 1 Kings regarding the 450 prophets of Baal is of no help in this debate.  One can easily assume that they believed that no overwhelming vindication of Elijah would be forthcoming.  He was simply a fool, who would be shown to be so.

If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and  molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far from being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRAS and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures can range from 40K to 150K.

You call that peaceful?  If you believed, as these people did, that they would be attacked by evil forces from the outside, found the scores of agents breaking into your compound what would you do?

Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved in its entirety into the ""subjective"" category by an idealist or  solipsist argument, and that we have this perfectly good alternate set of categories (subject, object, event) [which can be reduced to (subject, object, quality) without any logical difficulty] and why yes, I guess I *am* denying that self-evident truths are all in the mind of  the beholder.  #>>If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?

There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship. Parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that  children can do whatever they want?  NOT!  Part of being a parent means administering punishment when the child is at fault.  Part of being a  parent means giving instruction.  God tests us through the trial of life such that we may grow stronger.  He teaches what is right and  what is wrong.  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us, be it Heaven or be it Hell.  If God did not follow through with what He has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent.  In parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through with it, the children will not take that parent's words very seriously. God does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and what not to do.  By life's trials, we see the folly of doing our own will rather than His.  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting Him when it comes time for Judgement.  Do we follow Him?  I will.

I read his ""Satanic Bible"" a few years ago for a social studies project, as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called ""The Cult of Devil Worship in America.""  The latter included a very interesting interview with the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an instrument for one to realize the self.    When I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I don't consider LaVey's church to be at all ""orthodox,"" nor do I consider its followers ""satanists.""  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche, Crowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little touch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan. No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.  At any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a huge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr. and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the  way.)    I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as a Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of Satan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Webster's Dictionary and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same. --  ---                      __  _______                              --- ||| Kevin Marshall       \ \/ /_  _/  Computer Science Department ||| ||| Virginia Tech         \  / / /     marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu ||| --- Blacksburg, Virginia   \/ /_/                  (703) 232-6529 --- ",alt.atheism

Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an interplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person's self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely mental/verbal level, and don't usually find expression in society except in an impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.

It hasn't be proved, nor has it been disproved.  No one has a proof one way or the other, but many people are interested in it!   I've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the existence of God one way or the other.  The two possibilities are supernaturalism and naturalism.  Of course no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with naturalism.  In naturalism, any phenomenon that could be described as God is considered part of the natural world, to be studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance).   For example, if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced, ``I am God, I exist, and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity,'' and if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist) would say, ``Boy, we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we thought we did, and that loud voice is something new.  Perhaps we didn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.''  >I contend that proper implementation of the Christian faith requires >reasoning, but that reasoning cannot be used to throw out things you >don't like, or find uncomfortable.

Well, a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it, and 1 alone weighs about 200 pounds itself.          We decided against it.                                                         -jeremy  ",sci.space

Of course the chances of  Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics  that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few  important parameters.  The polygons are all convex.  They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)  I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons.  This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line. Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.  The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small  number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.  Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons.    >finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source >with it.

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term -- on the order of a few years before the orbit decays.  (Higher orbits last longer.)  Advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental aspects of their advertising.  Fred's argument is roughly akin to saying that it's bad to cut down trees, so we shouldn't advertise in newspapers.  Think that through, Fred.  Picture this: Our space billboard is a LARGE inflatable structure, filled with ""bio-degradable"" foam instead of gas.  It scoops up space debris as it orbits, thus CLEANING the space environment and bringing you The Pause That Refreshes at the same time.  Because of the large drag coefficient, it will de-orbit -- safely burning up -- within a year.  Embedded in the foam structure is a small re-entry vehicle, which does not burn up during entry.  It contains the electronics and propulsion system (which may be refurbished and re-used) as well as space science experiments proposed and built by high school students in advertiser-sponsored science fairs.  Advertisers buy time on the billboard, whose surface is made up of tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package.  The avionics can reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different parts of the globe.  Clever programming allows different languages to every country.  During orbital night, the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface, and small lights are revealed.  The lights spell out messages for all to see.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368                    ""HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH                     FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON                            JULY 1969, A.D.

All I said was that a right is whatever you or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn't come into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly, the people); from that point it defined legal rights.  ""Common law"" rights are vague and situational; that's why the people insisted on a Bill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what they demanded from the government.

"From: games@max.u.washington.edu Subject: Words from the Chairman of Boeing on SSTO type stuff Article-I.D.: max.1993Apr27.124850.1 Distribution: world Lines: 57 NNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.edu     Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more bare-bones.  In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike, maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it in.  After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.  So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all the difference.  So, on to the substance. The question was   Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by Mcdonnell Douglass?  Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me, then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last part first.  This is to the best of my recollection what he said.  As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers  about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point.  So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that  they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own.  Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually, this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are trying to do something with it.    Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?                      John. ",sci.space

Atheists and agnostics, I would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  An atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy of religion as a Christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists among the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore, the conflict between one's religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher must not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may be non-religious was a secondary point.   >Science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a >BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.  As opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.  Science does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma: skepticism.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  There is that  wonderful little creature known as the ""theory.""  Many of us believe in the theory of evolution.  We have no absolute proof that this  theory is true, so why do we believe it?  Because it ""makes more  sense than...?""  There is quite a bit of faith involved here.   >A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to >suit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND, >*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs >are deficient in some way.  Well, not ALL current beliefs are deficient, but basically I agree.   >Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed, >and new information can be obtained to improve them.  Ideally, this is true.  In reality, though, you have to acknowledge that scientists are human.  Scientists have egos and biases.  Some scientists assume a particular theory is true, refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever, and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof  for the theory.

Not really.  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco crisis ($7,500,000 I believe), especially considering the outcome. My point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare (Jonestown was in Guyana, incidentally, although we footed the bill for the clean-up), and the U.S. has far more important issues to address.  Compare the number of U.S. citizens who have died in mass suicides with, say, the number of U.S. soldiers who died during one week of the Vietnam War and you will see my point.  --  ---                      __  _______                              --- ||| Kevin Marshall       \ \/ /_  _/  Computer Science Department ||| ||| Virginia Tech         \  / / /     marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu ||| --- Blacksburg, Virginia   \/ /_/                  (703) 232-6529 --- ",alt.atheism

Organization: Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon     I didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, I just wanted to add a point.     The whole question of ""a right to a dark sky"" revolves around the definition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and good, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone representing you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution provides a ""Bill of Rights"" from which most if not all legal rights are considered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries have comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the U.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  To keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law and the International Court of Justice (correct name?) in the Hague, something I know little about.

You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,  Back in January and February there were several articles (Wash Post, Time...) saying that NASA was ""considering"" the option just as it is now ""considering"" a followup mission 6-12 months after the servicing mission.

"From: asecchia@cs.uct.ac.za (Adrian Secchia) Subject: Raytracing Colours? Keywords: raytracer colours realism vectors Organization: Computer Science Department, University of Cape Town Lines: 25  I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.  When an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first the normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln  where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light rays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.  Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours  along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).  The question is:    How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get   the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?  All colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components between 0 and 1.  If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?  -- Adrian Secchia  asecchia@cs.uct.ac.za ",comp.graphics

Then we all live happily ever after. :-)  Seriously, if we all agreed on the circumstances we're in, I suspect we'd all agree on the best course of action.  Unfortunately, I have no confidence that such a situation will ever arise.   Some of us think there's a big God in the sky, some don't.  Some think they've been chosen by God, others disagree.  Some think they are infallible, others think otherwise.  Until those disagreements over circumstances can be ironed out, there's little hope of everyone agreeing.  >     Or say, for all practical intents and purposes, there is no frame > of reference in which thus and such is good, isn't that approximately > objective, in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to > outrun a snail?  Yes.  I think that, for example, only a vanishingly small number of people would hold that there's a frame of reference in which gassing six million Jews is good.  So that's probably about as close to an objective moral value as I've encountered in my life so far.  >                       For example, if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area, > isn't it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act, even > though there conceivably might be some tail-end case that would justify it?  Well, I think your example's poor.

Right.  The key point, however, is that there are vanishingly few of these moral issues where we can get 99.9% of people to agree on the outcome for all frames of reference (and agree on the frames of reference...)  > #>                                                    What you do not get > #> is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist > #> is inferior to that of the man of peace. > # > #Sorry, but that's not so.

Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing.  Coming back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in  its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.  Any misalignment of the  plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will  require more fuel to adjust.  This was considered in the original deployment.

The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.

The most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say ""no, dummy, you're going the wrong way"".  	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii). A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles. This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with its auto-trace tool.  	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight, clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case.  	(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the woods. --  Roy Smith <roy@nyu.edu> Hippocrates Project, Department of Microbiology, Coles 202 NYU School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016 ""This never happened to Bart Simpson.""

When they use the _same_ deconvolution  software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some  incredible results!  There is every reason to believe that the results will  _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.    Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  It works  realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble.  You might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System.  Starting on page 52 of the  April, 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product. It lists for $1,290.  The article states: ""The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System  comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry  around.""  Even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects, ""it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter in the telescope's focal plane.""  Now just imagine how well this infant  technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that  has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in its development.

A theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported* by the *facts*. A theory is a mental construct, a speculation,  a model.  If it is a good model, it may be useful.  In science a theory is something that is supported by the  evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence. A *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not yet enough evidence to support it.  When a new hypothesis  is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain *all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or predict new facts.

Diplomatic :-)  I realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument, so I'll try to explain why I feel a mind is necessary.   Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They're great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not at working out the method itself.  As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks. Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program them into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, and write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see, the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material, much of which isn't used.  One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but (again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of 'if you see object X, then perform action Y,' and we don't seem to get anywhere. The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what conclusions to draw from it's experience.  The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are side-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also, neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate - can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's code?  The next problem is the sticky question of ""What is colour?"" (replace 'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy + different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn't? It shouldn't, because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do we see colour?   > >However, such a view is actually a nonsolution. How should minds be >able to act as observers, feel pain and pleasure and issue >commands any better than the brain? Moreover, how do the interactions >occur?  A bit of idle speculation...  If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction, with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called 'Unitary Evolution' (or 'U'), is governed by Schroedinger's equation and is well known. The second process, called various things such as 'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'R'), and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a 'measurement' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly change the wavefunction.  I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something else,' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X.' It seems reasonable to assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be the wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the wavefunction. Note, though, that we'd need more than U to explain R.)  Anyway, I'm speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to be some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear superpositions of anything, although there are alternative explainations for this. I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X, but since this is only speculation, that won't matter too much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics.

How do I do it?  	2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will tell me in ""mostly plain"" english how the vesa calls work.  	My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books, I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both gopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is some lock on this information.

It's about as bright as Jupiter at its best. There are two cosmonuats on board.  For the time to watch, tel. 0891-88-19-50 (48p/min peak 36p/min all other times, but prediction is at start of the weekly message so it only costs a few pence).  E-mail reports of sightings would be appreciated: give lat/long and UT (a few seconds accuracy if possible) when it passes ABOVE or BELOW any bright star (say brighter than mag. 3), planet or Moon.  With Moon in evening sky also, note that from somewhere in U.K. Mir will pass in front of the Moon each night! Please alert local clubs to the telephone newsline, and general public as Mir can cause quite a stir!  -Tony Ryan, ""Astronomy & Space"", new International magazine, available from:               Astronomy Ireland, P.O.Box 2888, Dublin 1, Ireland. 6 issues (one year sub.): UK 10.00 pounds, US$20 surface (add US$8 airmail).

Elizabeth Bartley) writes:  >I can certainly see opposing the ""Amen"" -- but that doesn't require  >opposing a moment of silence.  I already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause me to make another, independent reply.  The problem with a ""moment of silence"" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of ""allowing"" for religion amongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are required by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this.  There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this ""moment of silence"" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special times and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer  being able taking note of it.)  A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant ""mainstream"" religion.  All that a ""moment of silence"" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which doesn't NEED it, to have a ""special"" place set aside in the public schools. There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs, or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A Christian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during the day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non- Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the ""moment of silence"" it would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed forms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore, the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.  Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as a Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools), and a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians.  As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this ""moment of silence"" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And as a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, I suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians -- it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in ""making"" their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach what THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so.  If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of silence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment will only embarrass you.  Give it up. --  Michael L.

Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)? Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available? Q7: What is veronica? Q8: What is Available for Biology? ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q0:  What is Gopher?  A0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed      information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide      information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While      providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher      facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers      throughout the world.   ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?  A1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory      /pub/gopher  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?  A2:  You will need a gopher ""client"" program that runs on your local PC      or workstation       There are clients for the following systems.  The directory      following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous      ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory      /pub/gopher.

Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client      itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:         Type=1        Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu        Port=70        Path=        Name=Gopher Software Distribution.         Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and      look in the gopher directory.        There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.      The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine      ""consultant.micro.umn.edu"" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more      information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client      software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A      client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,      scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to      in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?  A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize      network lag.       Telnet Public Logins:       Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area      ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------      consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America      gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America      panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America      gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe      info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia      gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden      tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America      ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador      gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan        It is recommended that you run the client software instead of      logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the      custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)      and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features      of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file      to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp      sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.    --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?  A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University      of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help      our campus find answers to their computer questions.         It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information      System used by a large number of sites in the world.       Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to      count.        The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached      via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:           Internet Gopher Developers       100 Union St. SE #190       Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA       Or via FAX at:         +1 (612) 625-6817  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?  A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.      As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to:               - Search local WAIS indices.        - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using          built in gopher querying or using native http querying.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?  A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :       _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:                              ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)       _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online""      By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to       Computerized Archives.       veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles      in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica       is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher      items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.      Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy      to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the      gopher protocol.       To try veronica, select it from the ""Other Gophers"" menu on       Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:       Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace)       Type=1       Port=70       Path=1/veronica       Host=futique.scs.unr.edu  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Q8: What is Available for Biology?

I conditionally retain this reference in regard to Khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the  so-called ""Twelve Imams,"" which is in clear conflict with the Qur'an  in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example higher than that of the Muhammad, in that the Qur'an shows that the Prophet was clearly fallible, as well as (it appears, given your abstruse theological statment regarding the ""natures""  of the Twelve Imams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the  remainder of humanity, with the possible exception of Muhammad,  something which verges on the sin of association.  >As salam a-laikum  Alaikum Wassalam,  Gregg  ",alt.atheism

Have >you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch >was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage? Or that a >successful interception of a Scud was defined as ""the Patriot and Scud >passed each other in the same area of the sky""?  Of the ~93% (I have heard figures closer to 80%, but I won't quibble your figures), most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by enemy troops.  A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them around the clock.  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb munitions.    2.  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse.  The adjusted figures for number of Patriot kills of SS-1 derivitives is ~60-70%.  That figure came not from some fluke in the Pentagon, but a someone working with such stuff in another part of DoD.  3.  The statement precision bombing was the norm, is true around areas where civilians were close to the target.  We dropped by tonnage very little bombs in populated regions, explaining the figures.    >And of the 7% that was the ""smart"" stuff, 35% hit. Again - try to follow me >here - that means 65% of this ""smart"" arsenal missed.  This figure, is far below all the other figures I have seen.  If it is indeed accurate, then how do you explain the discrepancy between that figure, and other figures from international organizations? Most figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to 70%, which is  still far higher than your 35%.  Or does your figure say a bomb missed if the plane took off with it, and the bomb never hit the target, regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped?  Such methods are used all the time to lie with statistics.  >>                                                       The stories >> of ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. > >Prove it.

Rushdie was writing about a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing the actor ""Gibreel"" in the role of the angel whose name he took. Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims or implies that this is what actually happened.  It's somewhat like stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed prostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the Arthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens of others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer, consider Salman Rushdie's children's book ""Haroun and the Sea of Stories"" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific storyteller -- works with existing story lines.  >to ridicule Muhammad's integrity...  No.  Muhammad's [Mahound's] integrity is not really impugned in this part of the story, and there's no reason to think this was Rushdie's intent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and satanic), though he doesn't know their provenance.  It is not implied (in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:      "" *Not my voice* I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker     never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a Voice.       Mahound's eyes open wide, he's seeing some kind of vision,     staring at it, oh, that's right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He's     seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don't     know, can't say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my     mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.       Being God's postman is no fun, yaar.       Butbutbut: God isn't in this picture.       God knows whose postman I've been.""  It's ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan? Or something else?  The answer is not given.  To be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the role of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation, but this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very existence of a newsgroup named ""alt.atheism"" raises the same questions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is the real relevance.  If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is ""filth and lies"", and he ""asked for what he got"", are we next on the fatwa list?

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34 meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days.  As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial Reference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.  Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency Mode entry.  MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders 2 and 3.  Playback of DTRs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completed yesterday, was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight Sequence C9 execution.  The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart C9 to complete data playback.  Present planning is to perform playbacks between  as soon as Wednesday, or as late as Friday of next week (5/5- 5/7), dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity.  DTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second.  Upon verification of successful DTR playbacks, downlink will be maintained at the 4K S & E rate.      ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were somehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are ""guilty"" of their lifestyle, that pride in one's work is a bad thing, that Jesus died for me -- I don't want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an impersonal act where the person can't possibly even *know* me well enough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not.  I was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good thing.  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message of Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I'm just not compatible with Christianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I can't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you describe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.  >I know how that goes.  Knowing I couldn't and didn't want to  >live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me >outside, too.    Don't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I don't believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder -- not because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren't* in my character.  You may think there's nothing keeping me from just running around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I'm able, insulting people for the heck of it, because I'm not answerable to anyone; but you'd be wrong.  I'm answerable to myself.  A life like that would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.  >'Till I met the Man, that is.  My initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching and a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of God with me.  I finally decided that I had once ""felt"" this presence just as I had ""felt"" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a little tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I had believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.  Since then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in my darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for a moment and called out to whatever's out there, because I want to know the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I have not yet received an answer.  >= Only when I truly listened to myself, body and soul, did I realize >= that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being >= Christian.  There is a higher truth in the universe, and Christianity >= just ain't it. > >Any suggestions on what (or who or where) it might be, and why?  Nope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional universe may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional sphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts on this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four- dimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables become too much for us to even speculate on.  That is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to be, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor had anything to do with it.  >""OK,"" you may say.

Christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy book, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt trips, insinuations that I'm without morals, arguments from disbelief (""how can you possibly believe that God *doesn't* exist?""), and so forth.  All I'm asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced, but it's not going to be easy.  >So much as you don't like what we're ""selling"", there just may be someone >out there that can identify with it.  Methinks you could give us all a  >lesson in tolerance and back off.  Having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it's got these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly intolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you'll say that your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judge Christianity from the Christians I know.  I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's self, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that.  So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to realize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy, fulfilled life.  I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice things.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and they know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to believe, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who don't agree with them.  >Obviously, the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the >Christian's faith is far from conclusive, notwithstanding how vehemently we >propose otherwise.

I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at different x/y values, the ""ridges"" are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap.   Example:   Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)       Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)  Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing. Bravo!

How about the discussion of the STS Tether experiment.  Ran forward, it would suck energy from the Earth's magnetic field, while trivially slowing the Shuttle.

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of ""right"" and ""wrong"" (or ""correct/incorrect"" or ""true/false"") belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).  Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively. One can certainly ask if a percept is ""right"" (correct, true, veridical) or ""wrong"" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives.  Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.  Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with the first part (that the ""rightness"" of a moral position is a meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the ""correctness"" of the position.  Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold different moral values (feelings). ----------------------------------- John A.

Convenient?  It seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted to alt.conspiracy.  Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree' measurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than the more common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at least 2 misconceptions:  1.  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C.     Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are     iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun     were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel     parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be     trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.  2.  A fire is not an isothermal process.  There are 'hot' spots and     'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.   So the     weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to     imply.  And, even if it was, so what?  It would not have melted     anyway.  darin wilkins@scubed.com ________________________________ |                              | | I will be President for food | |______________________________| ",talk.religion.misc

Hathaway   The problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers.  When the mission was planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there was enormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.  THey have now planned for 5 EVA's,  an 11 day mission and have 2 reserve EVA's and an emergency EVA.  Obviously that is coming from somewhere. My guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.     I just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaper better,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable space manuevering tug  out of a BUs1,  and use that for the re-boost. it has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck.  pat  ",sci.space

You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network. Ignore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time of arrival.  With three detectors properly arranged, one can often get positions down to ~arc minutes.  BTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the fairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1 ms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing and t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the order of 16 light years.  I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from the wrong direction.

Contrary to what Dr. Fox has been saying, however, present consensus is *not* that the longer passage in Josephus about Jesus was inserted, but only that it was modified.    There is no question that it was *at least* modified (based on what Origen says--that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah), but I don't think the argument that it appears ""out of context"" is a very good one.

I'll tell you about my first flight.  At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while you have a cold).  At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response, since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment going and keeping track of all the parts during the ""return"" of gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay attention to physiology at that time.  After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly -- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid, concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous people who don't get sick on the thing.)  I didn't think of it as a ""constant sensation of falling"" so much as like swimming in air.  It's very close to the sensations I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.  Jerry: : >And what is the motion sickness : >that some astronauts occasionally experience?

One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME's, you don't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization burn(s).  On-orbit, SSME's are just dead weight, since we don't have an SSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means that you can't use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.  Throw-away SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not- quite-man-ratable.  But I doubt we'd do that; the cost of a launch failure is too high.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368       ""...Development of the space station is as inevitable as        the rising of the sun."" -- Wernher von Braun ",sci.space

And  Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  JOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?  Verily,  verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me thrice.  JOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.  >destruction of cities (what said was jeremiah was zechariah)  (This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made!

Mark and Luke speak of many far off, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less. John says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and Mary Magdalene.  >Jesus' last words   Matt.27:46,50: ""And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,  saying, ""Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?"" that is to say, ""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?""  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice, yielded u the ghost.""  Luke23:46: ""And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, ""Father, unto  thy hands I commend my spirit:"" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.""  John19:30: ""When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is  finished:"" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.""  >Events of the crucifiction  Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an earthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to many (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints.  John is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.  >Burial of Jesus  Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was supposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.  >How long was Jesus in the tomb? Depends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will spend ""three days and three nights in the heart of the earth"", and Mark 10:34 has ""after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again"". As far as I can see from a quick look, the prophecies have ""after three days"", but the post-resurrection narratives have ""on the third day"".  >Time of the Resurection  Matthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it was dark.  > Who was at the Empty Tomb?  Is it :  MAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.  MAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother  of  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.  JOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it  was  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.  >Whom did they see at the tomb?  MAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. MAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as snow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as dead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.  MAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on  the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.  LUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:  JOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and  the  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.  >Belief that the disciples stole Jesus's body  Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes this claim.  >Appearences of the risen Jesus  Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told them, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only appearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples.  Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that they told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.  Luke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to Emmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but was unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally recognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem, they told the disciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them, frightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them.  John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in Jeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but Thomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.	Once more Jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not recognised.  After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat together and converse.  The book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus contradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of God: ""And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight.  And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood by them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven, shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven"" Acts 1:3-11  Paul outdoes every other ""authority"" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500 persons between the time of the resurection and the assension, although he does not say where.	He also claims that he himself ""as one born out of due time"" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.  >The Ascension  Matthew says nothing about it.	Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven.  John says nothing about it.  Acts contradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)  >When second coming?  MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.  MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till all these things be done.  LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till all be fulfilled.  1 thessalonians 4:15-18  >How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention  1 Corinthians 15:5 (12) Matthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12) Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection) MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  > ascend to heaven 	""And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."" (2 Kings 2:11)  	""No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, 	... the Son of Man."" (John 3:13)  As you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses, you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right!  (In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error, the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth. (Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of truth.)                     Alan  ",alt.atheism

An interesting question would be if atoms > are objects (classical) or phenomenon (neo-quantum) or what?  I've been following this train of talk, and the question of dismissing atoms as   being in some sense ""not real"" leaves me uneasy.  It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects, and therefore the   underlying thing is not necessarily real.  The tree outside my window is in   this category... is observe the light which bounces off of it, not the tree   itself.  The observation is indirect, but no more so than observations I have   made of atoms.  Also, what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done   with individual atoms.  I am thinking in particular of atom trapping   experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno   effect, where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time.  Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying   either.  One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid   technical background in the field.  What I read seemed a little confused a   quite a red herring.  Anyway, if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think, it   worked.

Well, suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was sent towards a black hole.  As it got closer to the event horizon, the red shift would keep increasing.

Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course, this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.

The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say ""propel"" rather than ""power"", the answer is ""sort of"".)  Yes, you can use interaction with the Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential applications for this.  However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations, however.  What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays, and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.  If you want more information, trying looking up ""electrodynamic propulsion"", ""tether applications"", and ""magsails"".  >Can the idea of a ""dragless"" satellite be used in part to create the >electrical field?  No.  A ""dragless"" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if* there was no drag.

"From: mcelwre@cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject: LARSONIAN Astronomy, Physics, CREATION Organization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Lines: 556         The following partial summary of a Theory of the Universe includes a little-known description of the CREATION of our Solar System:                         LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics                 Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists            CLAIM to be looking for a ""Unified Field Theory"" in which all            of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single            set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the ""Reciprocal System"", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) ""The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.""                      (2) ""The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.""                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL            DATUM"").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson                           The following is a complete list of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  Some of the early            books are out of print now, but still available through            inter-library loan.                      ""The Structure of the Physical Universe"" (1959)                      ""The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom"" (1963)                     ""Beyond Newton"" (1964)                      ""New Light on Space and Time"" (1965)                      ""Quasars and Pulsars"" (1971)                      ""NOTHING BUT MOTION"" (1979)                      [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION ""Super                                                              Collider"".]                      [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]                 ""The Neglected Facts of Science"" (1982)                       ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" (1984)                     [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical                                                             mysteries.]                        ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"" (1988)                 All but the last of these books were published by North            Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and            should be available via inter-library loan if your local            university or public library doesn't have each of them.                  Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available            from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),            1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal ""RECIPROCITY"".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"",            ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, ""THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super            Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific""            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the ""Supercollider""?!                                 Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help ""prove"" Einstein's ""General Theory of Relativity"".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by            INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special            Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION""            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron            stars"", ""black holes"", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black            holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and            concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original ""black holes"".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black            holes"", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is            clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black            hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to ""prove"" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book ""NOTHING BUT            MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.""                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate).             (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and            ""below"" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as            the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.                                  For more information, answers to your questions, etc.,            please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS).                    UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this            IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED.                                           Robert E.

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43 (Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results  indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.  2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received properly.  3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS (Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).  4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.  6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28. The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately 20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.       After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink, a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test mini-sequence.  7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees, back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4 degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN (3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 203 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN (Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).  2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant schedule changes or significant problems were reported.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  	Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU) 	Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU) 	Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour 	Distance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km 	Round Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds  SPECIAL TOPIC  1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the sequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process. In the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial RRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the stator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the RRA slew test.      ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

I realize that it is not possible to penetrate such logic, but is there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not ""attempt"" anything, and further that an attempt to ""reconcile"" implies a lack of omniscience?

God is God.    But all humans are sinners, thus all pre-Jesus humans should have been punished with death.  We aren't punished with sin now, of course, because God has changed.  He required a brutal, sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death.    >He cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in His midst.    Yet he does so now.  He has changed.  The sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our sins.  Besides, his ""midst"" is everywhere, so your statement is meaningless. He tolerates sin in Hell, which surely is in his midst as well.  Also, given that he is all-knowing, he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins, as well as when and where, so what does tolerance have to do with anything.  All of this is absolute nonsense, unless your god is not indeed all-knowing and all-powerful, or unless he doesn't take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you claim.  >And the Israelites knew this!  And >still, some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed.  Were these >people KIND and LOVing themselves?    Not relevant.

I'm thinking to treat the raw data.. not >compressed.   	Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed HDTV.  Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB, even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or 18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).  	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.  	Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use at least somewhat compressed data.  You don't have to go to full compression to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier to deal with.  --  GNU Emacs is a LISP operating system disguised as a word processor.  - Doug Mohney, in comp.arch  Randell Jesup, Jack-of-quite-a-few-trades, Commodore Engineering. jesup@cbmvax.commodore.com or rutgers!cbmvax!jesup	BIX: rjesup   Disclaimer: Nothing I say is anything other than my personal opinion.

Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can  engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order  harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a  satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of  months to years.        My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT  satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In  particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in  altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude  of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18  March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the  limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.)       This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71  degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is  unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But  it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the  situation.       (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long for this to be possible.  The CGRO, is, what, 10 meters long?  You'd need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this.  What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors (also as a function of photon energy).  Each of the detectors does not have isotropic response.  To do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector, and even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back onto the spacecraft.

From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an introduction to the article ""Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon"", by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by Paul Kurtz.   	Mormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 	-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of 	the world's fastest growing religions, with as many as 	200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church's 	aggressive missionary program, covering more than one 	hundred countries, it is spreading even to third world 	countries. 	 	Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and 	evangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict 	authoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly 	receives revelations directly form God, and a group of 	twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief 	and practice, the church is opposed to abortion, 	pornography, sexual freedom, women's rights, and other, in 	its view, immoral influences of secular society, and it 	forbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea. 	 	Centered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy 	and politically powerful in Utal and many other western 	states.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft 	Benson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family, 	the Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed 	government officials. 	 	The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by 	Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had 	found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill 	and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he 	had been able to translate the writing into the _Book of 	Mormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written ""by 	the commandment of God,"" claims that the ancient Hebrews 	settled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors 	of the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who 	have been baptized in the ""true church"" will be reunited 	after death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can 	be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the 	hereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been 	considered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and 	as heretics by religious fundamentalists. 	 	Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was 	both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because 	of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from 	Palmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois, 	where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham 	Young, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over 	the leadership of the church and led the Mormons further 	westward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City.  	Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of 	polygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice 	in nineteenth-century America. 	 	While other religions go back many centuries -- 	Muhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism, 	3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are 	difficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon 	roots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this 	history objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny 	is dangerous to the faith. 	 	In the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles 	about the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong 	member of the church, provides a detailed critical 	examination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of 	Mormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion 	of an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a 	Mormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the 	history of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz 	  The article itself is super.    ,...,.,,  /666;    ',     ////;    _~ -    (/@/----0-~-0  ;'  . `` ~ \'   , `    ' , > ;;|\..((   -C---->> jimtims p00168@psilink.com  ;;| >-  `.__),;;  ",alt.atheism

"From: neese@cerritos.edu Subject: Hell Distribution: world Organization: Cerritos College, Norwalk CA Lines: 110      In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words  translated into the word ""hell"".  These Greek words have totally different  meanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.      In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the  New Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol... meaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be  likened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)      Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell to translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.        Why?  Because when seeing the word ""hell"" many readers impute to it the  traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never  remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!      In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of  the dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of  ""shadowy realm.""  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to  this hell.      The second ""hell"" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in  scripture, 2 Pet.2:4; ""For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast  them down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be  reserved unto judgment...""      Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14;  Rev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels  (now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to  Tartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the  mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).      Tartaros, then, is a ""hell"" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or demons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe  the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible  is there any mention of men being put into this particular ""hell"".      The the third word that is translated as ""hell"" in the Bible is Gehenna. It comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning ""valley of Hinniom.""  Hinnom is a  deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.      In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including  infant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made  their children ""pass through the fire"" to the god Molech.  The rites were  specifically celebrated in Tophet, the ""place of abhorrence,"" one of the chief  groves in the valley).      King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He  defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later  the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for  sewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were  also burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding  by a constant supply of garbage and refuse.      Aceldama, the ""field of blood"", purchased with the money Judas received for the betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.      So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?        In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working  religious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the  re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming. Their fate is revealed by the apostle John: ""And the beast was taken, and with  him the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire  burning with brimstone.""          Where will this temporary lake of fire (this ""hell"") be?      The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: ""For  Tophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is  prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood,  the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it"" (Isa.30:33).      One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled  fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).      But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible  say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of  fire?      In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be  thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will  become of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity?        The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna  fire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This  punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the  ""second death"" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a  further resurrection.      The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.                                 The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. ""For, behold, the day  cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do  wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up..."" (4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be ""ashes under the  soles of your feet...""(Mal.4:3).      Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living  torture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or  valley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left,  but ashes!       Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means  complete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The  Bible says, in Romans 6:23, ""The wages of sin is death"", not eternal life in  torture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of  life.           Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD! ",talk.religion.misc

Lines: 117 Distribution: na NNTP-Posting-Host: cass.ma02.bull.com  Russell Turpin, as is his wont, has raised some interesting issues  in his struggle with the Christian texts and the Christians.  Unfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is  not available. The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable  result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such  as humanity.   Also unfortunately (perhaps) I have a deadline in two weeks, the  responsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience,  from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray, as it were.   Let me then say what I can, briefly.  -----  >The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are >so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.    This point, for the net.browsers who also still read books, is pursued throughly in Kaufmann, Critique_of_Religion_and_Philosophy.  >The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed, >in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if >he has ""ultimate responsibility.""   This is a theological statement worthy of Barth. Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)  >Indeed, many traditions present >an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret >loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and >relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely >because it would be wrong for man to assume such ""ultimate >responsibility."" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding >goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean.   This requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them. I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is a reasonable assumption.   >And who is to say that this interpretation is ""twisted""?  There >are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward >reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.  Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian glasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the NT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some points in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly  abrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with adequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew, and probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) )  This part is, I discover, what most moves me to post:  mls> I am a ""radical"" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.  >No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel  >seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the >gospel.  Russell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate. Michael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal,  which seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are  possible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Merton was a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Francis was a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed?  mls> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me mls> tell you something about Christianity? ...  Michael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have two hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) ) Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity; Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' More direct, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?' The implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the  tradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your idea of the tradition doesn't include him, Change your idea of the tradition!  >The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per >se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and >gays.    How can one answer this while staying on the more general issue? I'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael) on this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement.  One verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, from Paul (of all people):  'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28 {I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry  them in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...'  (roughly, from Romans). [If Russell would promise to convert based on these or any other verses,  I'd promise to get the full context for any that he requires :-) :-)]  >In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that >make Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would >be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by >Christian interpretation.

[....]  Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker' is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.  I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider themselves such.  Following is the definition from ""Jargon File 2.9.10"". (This is also known as the ""Hackers Dictionary"".)  The definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:     :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.      1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable      systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most      users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who      programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys      programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A      person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is      good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,      or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX      hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who      fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One      might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the      intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing      limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to      discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password      hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.       The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global      community defined by the net (see {network, the} and      {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described      is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see      {hacker ethic, the}).       It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe      oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an      elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new      members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego      satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if      you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled      {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.     :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing      is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of      hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and      facilitating access to information and to computing resources      wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun      and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits      no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.       Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no      means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe      to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and      giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that      *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary      control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}      project.       Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of      cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.      But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who      see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On      this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy      to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,      preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it      was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an      unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.       The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker      ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share      technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing      resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as      {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})      can function without central control because of this trait; they      both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be      hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.  :  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is :  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large. : To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who : says ""Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..."" :-)  Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So, in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the workplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.  : >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way. :  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)  Language works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is to communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place, then language is working.  -- |================= #include <stddisclaimer.h> ================///=============| | ""AMIGA: The computer for the creative mind"" (tm) Commodore /// Weber State  | | ""Macintosh: The computer for the rest of us""(tm) Apple \\\///   University  | |== ""I think, therefore I AMiga"" -- val@csulx.weber.edu ==\///= Ogden UT USA =| ",comp.graphics

Well, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would be irrational.  Which is it?  The first part of the second statement contains no information, because you don't say what ""the beliefs"" are.  If ""the beliefs"" are strong theism  and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it.  |Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of |their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.

Indeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.   I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do.  I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought  down for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting, cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment  mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second  time.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a  few years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two  servicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down  and take it up again.  Ben  ",sci.space

GL stands for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.

I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus.  In the real world (tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those people who are of the same opinion as they are.

At this point,  many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science, Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements Act.                               There is a small group of activists in southern California  who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns. We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting America back to the Moon.         Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert  for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993.         All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's office. As more is known, it will be passed on.         However, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose.                             This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources  Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson's staff review a bill.         If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians.         If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space Society).  --- Maximus 2.01wb ",sci.space

This is very well shown in the book ""Punishment in Islamic Law"" > by Mohamed S. El-Awa (American Trust Publications, 1981). >   I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an. In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished.  Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.  However, when an apostate makes attacks upon ""God and His Messenger"" the situation changes. Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps  charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation changes. The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.  There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc.  against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm  to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation,  the unilateral attack and the spreading of ""fasad"" that  would apply in the case of Rushdie.  The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an  offensive book (banning the book is secondary) - a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many Muslims, and Rushdie's (and his publishers) Media games.   > Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter > how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.

I think any sensible human being can see this, so I personally > think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty, > for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace > regarding this particular subject.  I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe that one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33. Every verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding ""circumstance of revelation"" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the Muslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task. It is not necessarily a simple ""this or that"" process. There may be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters impinge on the situation.  In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an. The Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith. If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that. However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the State, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society, the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there  are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one  should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of  these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:  ""...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one, and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances  of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of the Qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer, the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive, and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know the Qur'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an...."".  Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur'anic verses (""Why should not a company from every group remain behind  to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn  people when they return to them, so that they may beware."" (9:122)), a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion) are many. I've listed a few major  divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these headings.  - Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory). - Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir. - Logic (mantiq) - A knowledge of Hadiths - A knowledge of transmitters (rijal) - Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur'an, Sunnah, Consensus, Reasoning)  The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves: - discussion of imperatives (awamir) - discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi) - discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meanings - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated  The principles of Application of the law involves: - principles of exemption - principles of precaution - principles of option - principles of mastery  The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith.   Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the famous hadith of the Prophet (S.A.) in which he says: ""The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as  long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures, and wealth of this world."" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: ""O Messenger of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?"" He (S.A.) replied: ""By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for your religion and shun them."" I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.  The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as ""The fortress of Islam"". My only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is  delineated in the Qur'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion  are cautioned.  The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is, apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him.  > Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam.

I have never attacked your specific beliefs -- that's *your* approach, remember?     Stating that other people who depend solely on the Bible have other views is indeed proof that the Bible can be interpreted many ways, which has been my whole point all along.

The first fully international issue has been published and echoes  are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si).   Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993  Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you  will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page -- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100); and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views into the discourse.    A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences, mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology  (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the area in question.    On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published. The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional  achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the  understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.    The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated. A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.    Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.) and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome. You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail. On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.    E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect. You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US, Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So, you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning our common interest and job.  At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and  philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed, and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail and by other means.  Sincerely yours,  Anton P. ""Zeleznikar Editor-in-chief ",comp.graphics
